1000001	They get hurts and keep in their mind that they are treated like they're not person.	0
1000002	They said that Austrailia had very beautiful nature.	0
1000003	It makes me feel sad and annoyed because he suffered a lot from the disease which was caused by the secondary smoking eventhough he didn't smoke at all.	0
1000004	I really like Swimming.	0
1000005	Then I feel I am with my grandmother.	0
1000006	I met him that I submitted my resume.	0
1000007	They suggest that it is an invasion of privacy and freedom.	0
1000008	Because using cellular phones is too dangerous and it is a violation of other's right, it should not be allowed.	0
1000009	So when we advie only by talking, they don't understand enough.	0
1000010	The first reason why men have to spend their time as a soilder is that the comflict between North Korea and South Korea.	0
1000011	For example, students can require their teachters to allow them to go to school cafeteria during the class.	0
1000012	Therefore I don't agree to the physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1000013	So we should prohibit people doing experience using animals.	0
1000014	For example, first, my high school homepage was a space of communicating on the base of annoymous system.	0
1000015	Although we can't recognize the sense's power but they are effective and good ways.	0
1000016	What she love is what I love.	0
1000017	Actually our daily lives are able on the basis of animals' sacrifices.	0
1000018	If teachers punish student with affection, physical punishment can be the best system fot teachers to direct students.	0
1000019	In conclusion, the Korean military service has a possibility that many different problems happen.	0
1000020	My uncle, the guitar's possesser at that time, willingly gave me his sweet memories, and I got a family-successed instruments.	0
1000021	Also, there is the problem of the third hand smoking.	0
1000022	One country needs its military to depend itself from danger.	0
1000023	because the products developed usually have many transformed version, and must be experimented at exactly the same creature.	0
1000024	I think people should use their real name on the Internet.	0
1000025	small habits like not using cellular phones are important.	0
1000026	In experiments, animals would be subjects and be the key to search right remedies of diseases.	0
1000027	In other words, I`m saying that smoking MIGHT be permitted in public buildings.	0
1000028	The loss of control to student can cause the decrease of quality of education.	0
1000029	In my opinion, we have to prevent drivers from using cellular phones while driving.	0
1000030	Also literature teacher in my high school teach literature very fun.	0
1000031	and he has belief with his decision.	0
1000032	No, I think all Korean men must not be forced because all people never have a same trait.	0
1000033	My best friend is my high school friend.	0
1000034	Moreover, it's very selfish idea that so many other things should be lost to survive more human.	0
1000035	This shows nessisity of physical punishment of teachers.	0
1000036	In past vacation, I went to Australia.	0
1000037	Her parents works in supermarket, so she often helps them to carry the boxes, calculate customer's goods.	0
1000038	Futhermore, builing's owner had to reconstruct his building.	0
1000039	Most of all, there is law that force the man to complete military service, but there is no law in democracy that impress the mankind's basic will which is called 'freedom'.	0
1000040	of course, some teacher are very heavy phisical punishment.	0
1000041	Using cellular phones distributes drivers.	0
1000042	Every moment that I made a problems, she was sad more than me and concerned about my future with real heart.	0
1000043	or give your ringing phone to anybody in your car.	0
1000044	So my mother's gift always make me blieve "Dreams come true.".	0
1000045	There are still dangers of war as we can see in the 'Yeon Pyung Do' event.	0
1000046	Second, because all men in Korea should complete military service, the quality of life in military is very poor.	0
1000047	Obviously, school should not be the place of fearness to students.	0
1000048	That is privacy.	0
1000049	we seen a many fishes in aquarium.	0
1000050	So, smokers can be harmful to all people, especially weak people such as children, pregnant woman and old people.	0
1000051	The big power.	0
1000052	She and I have been friend since we were 12 years old.	0
1000053	And we went to hawondae, we have a good time in the sea.	0
1000054	Do you think it is time wasting?	0
1000055	My favorite teacher in high school is my homeroom teacher when I was 18.	0
1000056	There is a mountain Alfs!	0
1000057	I am in the music team.	0
1000058	The present is a doll.	0
1000059	It can be a very big problem, for example, their wrong actions go worse and worse so they can be criminals.	0
1000060	Around me, my friends are sitting and someones are standing.	0
1000061	It's a clear abuse and it should be punished.	0
1000062	I want to learn how our body is working.	0
1000063	You may not deny smoking is bad for smokers because it hurts their lungs.	0
1000064	To preserve the rights of teachers, we act this suggestion.	0
1000065	I've learned writing from my uncle, who is writer, since I was 5 years old.	0
1000066	Last, school have to raise polite students.	0
1000067	We can spoil our children!	0
1000068	I would like to go to Egypt if I have a chance to travel.	0
1000069	These are what I do in my free time.	0
1000070	For example, Disneyland, even though a lot of people visit there, I heard it is really clean and well organized.	0
1000071	I live in seoul.	0
1000072	but we live together with lots of animals and help each other.	0
1000073	I like Korean subject.	0
1000074	These are so powerful that human do not make vaccine yet.	0
1000075	There are two reasons.	0
1000076	I think that a ring which has a promise with my girl friend is a special meaning for me.	0
1000077	But can you make your family alive by using that money?	0
1000078	It is giving chance to North Korea to think about war.	0
1000079	It is generally said that math is complicated and boring subject.	0
1000080	In a nutshell, physial punishment pales in comparison to communication between teacher and student.	0
1000081	There are also young children who might be influenced by smoking.	0
1000082	The forbidding by the law is overprotecting for children.	0
1000083	Because that is almost the largest problem to Japan.	0
1000084	And it is the time when our head gets really bright and intelligent.	0
1000085	There are two reasons why I think like this.	0
1000086	Firstly, it affects badly on each man's life, for academic, time-wasting, mental reason.	0
1000087	There'remany bad peopel in the world.	0
1000088	Taking all of these things account, it is very important to use their real name on the Internet because it is helpful to keep people from violating other people's privacy and encourage people to speak and behave gently.	0
1000089	To solve the problem that very difficult makes me excited and happy.	0
1000090	And I want to add one thing to people saying using real name blocks people's expression.	0
1000091	So teachers' punishments never stop.	0
1000092	When i feel like stopping my work or my goal, i often read them.	0
1000093	First day, we went to Tokyo tower to observe city and ate Su-si which is one of the most famous foods in japan.	0
1000094	To be public buildings for public, smoking must be banned in all public builidngs.	0
1000095	So they do many bad work in their school.	0
1000096	He was also good at teaching students, but what I liked about him the most was how he cared about students.	0
1000097	It reminds me of the days in Rome.	0
1000098	Both options has some moral problems like crashing with major social rule that all life should be protected.	0
1000099	Some documentary or drama supplies my sensitive thirsty.	0
1000100	But in this case they also work for contry in other manners for example public agent.	0
1000101	Third, this age is human's age.	0
1000102	That's beacause there is some students who have the mind that don't respect the teachers and who are just hate teachers.	0
1000103	Although above things have very bad effects, I hope the one day that using real name on the Internet is realizing.	0
1000104	There are no compensation.	0
1000105	Physical punishment is necessary for educating.	0
1000106	It can compeletely danger and deplete our perished value, the freedom of communicating each other and the right that every humans can say their opinion while not limited by their religion, sex or age.	0
1000107	When we fight each other, It is not good for both of them.	0
1000108	For example guarding half line, working for cuntry man and taking very very hard disciplin.	0
1000109	There are some people that have pride only in cyber world(Internet).	0
1000110	My opinion is, as always, that it depends on the situation.	0
1000111	They can understand what teacher is saying.	0
1000112	If smoking is prohibited in all public buildings it will help both non-smokers and smokers in the building.	0
1000113	In conclusion, we have to use our real name on the internet because of the internet manner and real freindship in the cyber place.	0
1000114	For this is effective, of course all of the people should care the policy.	0
1000115	2 weeks ago, I saw the video middle school student is hitting his teacher.	0
1000116	and if the other car is going on the side, then the two car will be broken.	0
1000117	i also do exercise in saturdady morning.	0
1000118	I moved several times so I don't really have friends from my younger years.	0
1000119	I think the service is particular mandator.	0
1000120	It is really violent thing!	0
1000121	Second, students don't get afraid of teachers if they don't give physical punishment.	0
1000122	Kim, the math teacher.	0
1000123	Instead of the forced rule, I think it is the better choice to give men to have the choice to complete military service.	0
1000124	He said, only if I and my girlfriend perform the one part of the show, I would get something.	0
1000125	So, I got the best score in math in 3 years at high school.	0
1000126	We do know that human and animals must keep good relationship forever, and we learn this truth in all school.	0
1000127	so students learn everything needed in world of adult in school.	0
1000128	For example beginning discussion with speakers who are claiming to protect animal rights can also be one way.	0
1000129	My family can't live in an apartment building since her voice is too loud that it might make neighbors annoying.	0
1000130	First, because physical punishment can harm one's personal right to be respected.	0
1000131	As I mentioned response to action above, taking response is important and Using real name is a good way to give response to Internet user called 'netizen'.	0
1000132	Last year, I spend my week as study to up-grade my ability.	0
1000133	Also, he helped me a lot while I was preparing for the university exam.	0
1000134	But, it takes too much money to attend university, it is necessary to help my parents.	0
1000135	I have a special friend.	0
1000136	These days, one of the hot issues in education is physical punishment.	0
1000137	Third, we don't have much time to get a chance.	0
1000138	The reason is that if people use celluar phones and drive an automobile in one time, they would be endangered because they would mistake driving a car.	0
1000139	For instance, they can do some social volunteer works instead of going to military service In short, I strongly support the idea that the most important vurtue of people is responsibility for their country.	0
1000140	It's true that people tend to have a more aggressive when they need not to take an obligation.	0
1000141	I wasn't trying to listen, including of bad words songs and just wanted to have a song for my Drama class.	0
1000142	They think their time spares in military, while women are taking adventage of it.	0
1000143	Rather it makes them say bad word about the teachers and become rebelious against teachers and schools.	0
1000144	According to the statistics, about one fourth of all Korean people have some kind of automobiles such as cars, buses, trucks, and so on.	0
1000145	It`s beyond my discribtion.	0
1000146	When I was 8-year-old I be happened to my firsy vacatione.	0
1000147	Because they've even lived in such circumstances and they think that the proper physical punishment can improve the children's studying ability.	0
1000148	he give bread and snack for me several time in high school supermarket.	0
1000149	I liked P.E time in high school.	0
1000150	Parents can't stop them, so schools have to pull those kids out of it.	0
1000151	All she told us were very helpful.	0
1000152	At the first time, my yonger sister bought it for herself.	0
1000153	however, after learning science from him, my grade at science was ranked on high class, and it did make me like that subject, SCIENCE.	0
1000154	And last, he usually buy delicious food to his students.	0
1000155	They will find many ways not to join the army and escape from their duty.	0
1000156	Actually, there are people who cannot adjust to the society because they believe that their avatars on the Internet is real themselves.	0
1000157	That age is very important about study.	0
1000158	When I get in high school, I'm not good at math.	0
1000159	I think my last year vacation is very fun and nice.	0
1000160	I agree with them partly.	0
1000161	And they do too these days.	0
1000162	Howevery, I can say my special thing is pencil or pencil case?	0
1000163	No. All Korean men must not be forced to complete military service.	0
1000164	We can see that these famous people suffer from public's bad messages and even choose extreme dicisions like going to abroad or dying.	0
1000165	.	0
1000166	And if the amount of smokers is increased, not only direct smokers but also indirect smokers will be increased because smoking in public place affect non smokers.	0
1000167	It also was about living a life itself, which is the most important thing to learn.	0
1000168	They don't have any responsibility about it.	0
1000169	And maybe it will be the best method for human and anmials live with together.	0
1000170	I think these are the reasons why I like him.	0
1000171	Pushing all male can have another problem.	0
1000172	Teachers should have a power to teach students.	0
1000173	My best friend's name is BoRyung.	0
1000174	Stoping us from using phones while driving is to neglect that right.	0
1000175	We just assure them as a non-living things.	0
1000176	The reason is doing like that could grow possibility and the number of accidents.	0
1000177	But physical punishment, still, have to be eliminated.	0
1000178	And I often have a appiontment with my friends or my teachers.	0
1000179	When the student punished by something physically, he or she must be angry to the teacher rather than think about his or her bad behavior.	0
1000180	Because students are young and they don't know well about what their behaviors mean, they will do some rude behaviors and show bad attitudes to teachers.	0
1000181	I think Jung Jae's way to teach was so helpful to us.	0
1000182	There are so many controversies about all Korean men should be forced to complete military service or not, but I think all men should be forced to complete military service for some reasons.	0
1000183	Some people are worried about students' rights, but I am worried about teachers' rights.	0
1000184	For example, we both like Chaos, one of the most popular usemap game in Warcraft3.	0
1000185	But when every person on the Internet should use their real name when they write even a short comment, they won't be able to criticize unjustice or use sarcism to uncover the truth freely because they know they're being monitered now.	0
1000186	Because of these reasons, i think that all korean men shouldn't be forecd to military service Of course not, there are people who wish to participate in the military.	0
1000187	However I did not agree with them.	0
1000188	My favorite teacher in high school is Music History teacher, named Kyong-a Cho.	0
1000189	Therefore I want to learn a English in United States.	0
1000190	In 2010, I was bad son to my parents.	0
1000191	I went to Seomyeon with my freinds last week.	0
1000192	So, at first, we should not allow this 'rationalization' to evade car accidents.	0
1000193	As selecting a man or woman for jobs of saving people's safe and freedom, Korean men always don't need to go to military and to complete military service and it can take a good influence to society's all things.	0
1000194	So it is not the best solution that using animals in medical experiments but it is the second best solution that we can make in nowdays situation.	0
1000195	One of the most interesting incidents which occured past vacation was playing the guitar with my uncle.	0
1000196	In KSAT, he take math score, 100.	0
1000197	If this happens people easily get accidents.	0
1000198	because everytime we study.	0
1000199	It was very easy.	0
1000200	So I think the best solution is every smoker should think for non smoker voluntarily and don`t smoke in public buildings.	0
1000201	A research that multitasking was not effective makes these agree more persuasive.	0
1000202	I want to go to France if i have a chance to travel.	0
1000203	I usually spend my Saturdays with my friends.	0
1000204	Sometimes i go to trip with my family in saturday, because my parents work everyday except saturday and sunday.	0
1000205	But I agree that little in education system.	0
1000206	It is very sad vicious-cycle.	0
1000207	Today, there are many smokers.	0
1000208	It's the time that you can be careless while driving your car.	0
1000209	Although physical punishments are not proper, In school, it is true that physical punishments work to limit students' rude behavior and attitude.	0
1000210	Humans and animals are same because both of them have life.	0
1000211	In friends house, we hold mini food-contest.	0
1000212	I think that we need to have medical remedy.	0
1000213	Then, we have to make smoking areas in a building.	0
1000214	It would bring drivers to die or hurt.	0
1000215	It was a tough time.	0
1000216	if they use cellular phones while driving, they cannot watch front well.	0
1000217	We were classmates for three years at high school.	0
1000218	Because even though we love each other very much, we don't have lots of memories of taking a trip or doing something together.	0
1000219	As a result, some people are out of controll in cyber world.	0
1000220	Because I did't off at the 1st art grade during 3years, and my freinds was poor at this subject.	0
1000221	All the Korean will be patriots finally.	0
1000222	My secret things that I don't show others is in my room.	0
1000223	They are the same life as us.	0
1000224	Those reasons are why I like him.	0
1000225	Finally most students don't think that their teacher really hate themselves If there teachers give them physical punishment Impartially. they just feel bad because their bodies get pain.	0
1000226	He watched a TV show which introduced a person who suffered from lung cancer because of secondary smoking.	0
1000227	In many Internet sites, asked personal information such as real name, birthday, etc.	0
1000228	Many people says that it should be needed to maintain teacher's authorities.	0
1000229	Cigarette's unique scents and smokes make them feel disgusted and have unwanted symtoms like coughing a lot when they pass smokers.	0
1000230	In short, I think Using real name on the Internet makes information currents on the Internet slow and makes people quite.	0
1000231	And Men who completed military service are worth taking social advantages.	0
1000232	For example, who got master's degree in engeneering field.	0
1000233	If fire is broken the public building loss the many goods and many money and people can die.	0
1000234	I think all Korean men be forced to complete military service.	0
1000235	Smoking makes people's feeling great, however, that feeling is not forever.	0
1000236	At first we can not use human as subjection in medical experiments at a fundamental step.	0
1000237	But, the student think that bad thing is very small behave.	0
1000238	Many different people visits public building, including children, pregnent women.	0
1000239	Suyong often wake me up.	0
1000240	This is very serious problem recently.	0
1000241	I usually watch TV drama again.	0
1000242	I like Susi very much.	0
1000243	When we are driving, we use all of our body.	0
1000244	I was playing hide and seek with my young cousins in the garden.	0
1000245	However, one of my friend suggested me to learn it together, so I decided to do so.	0
1000246	Finally Brazil is the country of nature.	0
1000247	These days, we can easily see drivers using cellular phones while driving.	0
1000248	Maybe I get a chance to go down my hometown, I want to visit our English teacher.	0
1000249	So we have to use a animal in medical experiments.	0
1000250	Sometimes i downloaded movie with internet and watch it.	0
1000251	Nothing is important than the life.	0
1000252	For example, When I was an elementary school student, I have got punished because I didn't do assignment that day.	0
1000253	But i think experiments is acceptable when its purpose is go with people and animals.	0
1000254	In past man power was very important than man.	0
1000255	After that, we play some fun games and go home.	0
1000256	Rich people spend money to escape from military service and celebrities go to foreign countries when they become the age to complete military service.	0
1000257	That teacher's teaching subject was biology which I like most among science subjects.	0
1000258	And he was also in a full enthusiasm to teach students.	0
1000259	My favorite subject was Korean Literature.	0
1000260	I agree that smoking should be banned in all public buildings.	0
1000261	it means the Korean war can occur anytime.	0
1000262	It is a sheep-shaped doll which my mom bought at the our special restaurant.	0
1000263	Why is this happen?	0
1000264	Moreover, when they use cellular phones, their focus on driving is divided.	0
1000265	For examples, the duplicated sheep, Doli is a sucessful outcome throughout animal experiences.	0
1000266	Also, all Korean men have to spend 2 years of their precious time completing military service although it does not related to their career or way of lives.	0
1000267	So although i know my language well, i am curious of them.	0
1000268	It sounds to have little connection to this world, no one can foresee what will occur in our future.	0
1000269	Because I can talk to them about my false thing and sad story and they also talk to me about their hard thing in life.	0
1000270	They talk about miltary's life so I hear theirs talk and drink some beer, and I talk about my last one year life.	0
1000271	Unless we can use ID, fake name, we can't be free to speak any opinion except for wheather forecast.	0
1000272	Because the agreement is just to 'rest' the war not to 'stop' the war.	0
1000273	Then, they solute much problem in school.	0
1000274	The matters should be gone away and away.	0
1000275	If the relationship between them becomes bad, education can't be done appropriately.	0
1000276	While I teach friends who are not doing well in math I also studied math harder and felt that It's not the worrying factor anymore.	0
1000277	I think, her writes have substituted for her empty.	0
1000278	If there is no physical punishment, they don't realize that how they are rude to older people.	0
1000279	We have to prevent this situation in advance.	0
1000280	I said in upper line " Almost people have difficult doing more than 2 actions simultaneously."	0
1000281	May be animals don' know about their sacrefice, but we should help them with their help for us.	0
1000282	I belive so.	0
1000283	For example, spaghetti and pizza, which are my favorite foods, are well known.	0
1000284	Finally, compulsory military service is good for national finance.	0
1000285	I don't care he or she smokes or not.	0
1000286	Playing computer games, surfing the internet are very useful eradicate my stress.	0
1000287	Being thought as cruel and selfish, it gives a lot of benefits for human beings.	0
1000288	So we should take this in regard and classify the group which can complete military work or not.	0
1000289	Physical punishment cause bad results.	0
1000290	Scientists know animals were sacrificed for human.	0
1000291	For example, my grandfather had diabete.	0
1000292	so theacher just do talk them.	0
1000293	As a result, the student would not want to be physically punished again and try not to do the same things.	0
1000294	Before saying about the topic, I would like to speak about my experience.	0
1000295	i think that the yonsei university is special for our family first, my father and my mother are the yonsei university student they live in Muichaksa and learn togther and becme campus couple i think that my family start in yonsei university and that is root i have thought the yonsei university will be my college since i was middle school student because i think it is familiar to me, of course i have a lot of reason i select here and then i can satisfy with this school and my parent can so we can have good air in my house this is why i think thank you	0
1000296	And teachers should cure it.	0
1000297	So some do not bully a class mate again but the others do that again.	0
1000298	And principal reviews the punishment and chooses that the punishment is correct or incorrect.	0
1000299	And because there was understanding process, i could remember the theories more easily and could remember them more long time than any other subjects.	0
1000300	but I disagree this idea.	0
1000301	anyway that travel is great chance to me.	0
1000302	And we apparently need to take care of the experiments so in the process we shouldn't agonize the animals.	0
1000303	Some creatures' life should not be used for other life.	0
1000304	That is very intersting thing.	0
1000305	She give me some cookie and coke.	0
1000306	Because i like history and i majored in Music, Harp.	0
1000307	Second, somking people have rights to smoking.	0
1000308	Though smoking is very harm to healthe of direct smoker and indirect smoker, fringe to smoker's freedom is not good solve.	0
1000309	I insist that drivers be banned using telephone while driving.	0
1000310	Given that a student is addicted to stealing other people's things.	0
1000311	So Mass Media such as, TV, newspaper, and magazine companies choose a fiction name system to prevent such a bad effect.	0
1000312	That is to say, when the car is stopped, like a situation that you see a red light, you can use your celluar phones!	0
1000313	However, people should use their real name on the Internet.	0
1000314	Children needs physical punishment.	0
1000315	Some teachers can make students a better person, but some teachers can make the opposite one.	0
1000316	While talking to them step by step what they did wrong and what behavior they have to fix can move children's heart, physical punishment only makes situation worse.	0
1000317	People need to be careful while driving.	0
1000318	First, in economical parts, if smoking is banned in all public buildings, demands in selling smokes become decrease.	0
1000319	So, doing the have-to-do, military service, is good thing at Korea entire.	0
1000320	The exception is, for instance, schools for disabled people.	0
1000321	For the following two reasons.	0
1000322	so I think teachers should be taught about how they can do right physical punishment.	0
1000323	There have to reasons for the this question.	0
1000324	And that is Thinking.	0
1000325	s 1 month before, and i borrow my friend's car audi a4 turbo.	0
1000326	Because, The basic idea of people who argues prohibiting medical experiments using animals and that of people who don't eat meat are same.	0
1000327	She did not well in math.	0
1000328	But I will write at the view that I have when I take a car, not drive a car.	0
1000329	However all Korea guys are forced to complete military service for two years.	0
1000330	Teachers often ask students to write ans essay and also give them physical punishment.	0
1000331	That kind of physical punishment can't make sense.	0
1000332	Also that inventor might not be able to follow current flow of inventions since he had no chance to watch new inventions for 2 years.	0
1000333	Finally Public building is the place where all people can enter in.	0
1000334	Some peole argue that human beings should not use animals in medical experiments because they are also living creatures and have their own value.	0
1000335	But it can be under the nicked name policy.	0
1000336	But I think use of celluar phones should be limited in certain places or situation.	0
1000337	So military service has to be duty.	0
1000338	The reason I think it is special is because she gave me expensive electronic dictionary, though my family's econimic condition is not good.	0
1000339	The worst thing is, front street has subway stations, bus stops, banks, restaurants and attractions.	0
1000340	Without understanding feeling of each other our conversation is no more than animal's barking.	0
1000341	But after i bought it i used it only 6times.	0
1000342	And another possible problem is that hacking program will be developed.	0
1000343	We can put all the things we want to tell other by one nickname.	0
1000344	So I think I like Korean from that time.	0
1000345	As we have experienced, all of physical punishments are not vice.	0
1000346	Animal experiments are always issue for society.	0
1000347	So people behave less causious and write those words.	0
1000348	And it let students act so rude to their teachers, especially young,or female teachers.	0
1000349	also they think many teachers so easy.	0
1000350	It's very important to me because it is my only contact with my friends thesedays.	0
1000351	They should do what they want to do at that times.	0
1000352	So they can hurt with emotional pains.	0
1000353	always I got a poor grade.	0
1000354	I like her personality.	0
1000355	That is very nonsense.	0
1000356	It's not the healthy people we should focus on, it's the others.	0
1000357	So I can get a confidence in my work.	0
1000358	That is the method everyone is happy.	0
1000359	Without it, nobody would dare to speak his political or economic view.	0
1000360	If there are animals that are smater and stronger than human, maybe we are target that is used in experiments for that animals.	0
1000361	Second, there are people who are not able to conduct military services for religious reason.	0
1000362	First, smoking is not just bad for smoking people but for non smoking people.	0
1000363	Sometimes they bring it out and check how it tastes.	0
1000364	also my history teacher is so funny and it makes me like history.	0
1000365	Music teacher was very funny woman.	0
1000366	If the Internet system is the real name one, the peeple may disactively speak their opinion.	0
1000367	Mere physical punishment to the children can suppress the children and as a result, eliminates the cherish experience in their young age.	0
1000368	For all these reasons, physical punishment should be allowed in schools.	0
1000369	Some people say taking physical punishment is the most effective way to make students correct.	0
1000370	In fact, there is already these alternatives.	0
1000371	He is a good teacher.	0
1000372	Because all men is not healthy to complete their military service.	0
1000373	They are scared about other people's nagative response so they are depressed to state thier opinion.	0
1000374	In addition, when I arrive the top of mountain, I can feel fresh so, this activity is good mentally.	0
1000375	When I have terrible score at school exam.	0
1000376	Actually, I am worried about that too.	0
1000377	These days, whole nation is trying to reach the more advance country, there are lots of controversy on phsical punishment.	0
1000378	'Roma' was placed in Italy that is in Europe and remained many kinds of historical things.	0
1000379	The men only keep our Korea now.	0
1000380	That was one of the most interesting things in my last vacation.	0
1000381	Since these cases were shocking, people are now inclined to assert that physical punishment should be allowed in schools.	0
1000382	In current middle and high schools in Seoul, nonexistence of physical punishment accelerates students' moral hazard.	0
1000383	purpose(cheer up to me) was created.	0
1000384	And in 2008.	0
1000385	So we can study in fun.	0
1000386	No, I don't agree with it.	0
1000387	About all things, I think, We have to have a mind of middle.	0
1000388	I agree that people have to use real name on the internet.	0
1000389	If nonsmokers breathe in these chemicals through their skin, nose, and mouth, their body will take their tools.	0
1000390	Most Korean men are forced to serve the military service at the age of 20~24, the best period of their life.	0
1000391	To students who are in learning process, human rights can be protected by only studying hard, which is students' duty and rights.	0
1000392	Like this case, we can use animal experiments for developing animals' condition.	0
1000393	It's for me, not for my teacher.	0
1000394	He is very handsome so He was very famous teacher.	0
1000395	But nowadays, students take their rights for granted.	0
1000396	i studied hard and actually i almost pass the exam.	0
1000397	A year ago, a man killed his elementary school teacher because he thought that the teacher's punishment ruined his life.	0
1000398	However, it is clear that smokers are harming the non-smokers in another way.	0
1000399	my friend is good at playing table tennis.	0
1000400	Finaly they found animal hospital which can save half of his body and saved him.	0
1000401	Although she know everything about me, even worst part of mine, she has never blamed me of that.	0
1000402	In conclusion, My saturdays are playing days.	0
1000403	Therefore we need punishment.	0
1000404	If someon thinks Using real name to prevent crimes, I think it isn't effective way to prevent crimes, so I disagree that people must use their real name on the Internet.	0
1000405	My family sometimes drink tea with it, and whenever we do, mother tells us what she felt when she first got this jar.	0
1000406	And some my best friends are very smart.	0
1000407	This problem's cause is no using real name on the Internet.	0
1000408	It means that young children are educated by adults.	0
1000409	But they are Korean.	0
1000410	She always talked with patience to us.	0
1000411	However, at least in Korea, it seems impossible that this peaceful situation happens.	0
1000412	Physical punishment can't be effective way to teach the student.	0
1000413	I want to go England.	0
1000414	And korea`s population is smaller than other countries.	0
1000415	Second reason I love music and song.	0
1000416	"But I want to say this, "Through Animal experiments, animals WHO has a chance to live must be in pain".	0
1000417	For not using drivers hand when driving, there are two resolvement.	0
1000418	also, people upload their comments just for points not for exact information.	0
1000419	It is about the security and more essential freedom to live without fear.	0
1000420	damaged mental health brings about stresses.	0
1000421	When children go to a wrong ways, teacher let them sit in the thinking chairs, think about their action, and sorry themselves.	0
1000422	The turtle is only pet that we breed.	0
1000423	it expands our relationship with varying people.	0
1000424	But I think that if military service is changed to a voluntary system and a salary is increased, young men want to go the army and the power of the army is also increased.	0
1000425	I like eating and I heard that France has very delicious foods.	0
1000426	Or he can bring a student making troubles bad scores.	0
1000427	In that reson smoking is more harmful with around people who don't smoke.	0
1000428	It only makes children feel fearful and angry.	0
1000429	that's ot a presentation just a small talk.	0
1000430	Yes. Drivers of automobiles shound not to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1000431	As long as Korea is divided as South and North, we should keep our security for the sake of the independence of the nation.	0
1000432	so don't do the physical punishment.	0
1000433	Finally, schools without physical punishment just don't suit to our education system.	0
1000434	First reason is there is difference between importance of human's life and animal's In our society.	0
1000435	so for student hit by vicious teacher, space where student can express their feeling about physical punishment and tell their innocence is needed.	0
1000436	If the students commit the bad job, but, teachers don't give physical punishment to students.	0
1000437	That's the way of gathering power to spend another tardy week.	0
1000438	We need to change our mind about teacher and student.	0
1000439	and People will talk to each other in familiar way.	0
1000440	Those things will make net users behave more matually by themselves.	0
1000441	Thus, Korea should maintain the number of army by keeping the military service dutified.	0
1000442	if our government does not force to our men to finish military service, our army's power will decline, and the quantity of army will diminished.	0
1000443	It help me to reduce lots of stress from weekday.	0
1000444	And physical punishment can save time for children.	0
1000445	But Korean men can't do everything when they are in military service.	0
1000446	If you are talking or text messaging, you have to pay attention not only driving also your new tasks.	0
1000447	For example, i usually heard about news on TV that the people were killed by their bad behavior.	0
1000448	It sounds quite valid but I think it is necessary to use animals for medical experiment for three reasons.	0
1000449	In these days, there are many news about physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1000450	The world does not be controled by war.	0
1000451	I Don't agree that we must use our real name on the Internet.	0
1000452	His lecture is very good.	0
1000453	Because it can limit people to express their opinion on the Internet.	0
1000454	I'd just like to say, 'Stop meaningless killing.	0
1000455	I think children need both the advise and the physical punishment.	0
1000456	So smoking in public palce may have bad effects to other people.	0
1000457	We are not all in this world.	0
1000458	They have the right to breath clean air everywhere.	0
1000459	Hence Smoking in a public area influent other people.	0
1000460	However, I think these opinions are non-sense fundamentally, because the animals don't have rights.	0
1000461	Today, the war is not just a fight like hitting each other.	0
1000462	Other teachers who teach students in other schools usually punished physically.	0
1000463	However public building is every people uses place, include smoking people and non-smoking peole.	0
1000464	I am not a smoker and I hate smoking.	0
1000465	It means the increase of their expense, so these insurance companies choose the option that increases the insurance fee.	0
1000466	The country I like to go first is the USA.	0
1000467	It is okay that people do their habit in all public buildings.	0
1000468	When I studied math more harder, the score rose correspondently.	0
1000469	I want to experience all of this.	0
1000470	Of course, some people could suggest that they do not have to be restricted for using a phone since they have freedom to use their cell phone.	0
1000471	Elementary school's students are very young so they don't know what they do and why they are got physical punishment.	0
1000472	Because i learned Japanese so i want to test my Japanese ability.	0
1000473	I alway listion to music, watching TV.	0
1000474	Secondly, animal medical experiments can contribute to the society.	0
1000475	in this situation, To do not physical punishment is so dangerous Second, Do a normal physical punishment is not bad.	0
1000476	They are very cute and i loved them.	0
1000477	To get a higher score on Korean test, I took lectures of famous teachers.	0
1000478	This politic is one of many politic that save our life.	0
1000479	I see why the drivers talk on the phone while driving.	0
1000480	Public buildings are for 'publics', but people don't want to go there.	0
1000481	To summerize, I absolutely do not agree with punishing children physically.	0
1000482	they are not afraid because they are not prohibited to use the internet.	0
1000483	Some people may afraid contact with other people.	0
1000484	My mother was holding her cell phone at that time, and after the call, when she tries to turn off the phone, she couldn't make a turn adequately so her car hit the tree on the street.	0
1000485	If students don't act properly, I don't think the solution is the physical punishment.	0
1000486	at first in England there was premier league.	0
1000487	that is reason that i like first friend.	0
1000488	That doll was a symbol of her feeling, so I really like it.	0
1000489	we like eat cow, pig and so on.	0
1000490	it is terrible for hard-studying students and they may do not get the grade that they want.	0
1000491	I can communicate easily with the smart person.	0
1000492	I have a gold ring.	0
1000493	when you live in Korea you can claim your liberty.	0
1000494	Here are the reasons.	0
1000495	It is because of Korean's low mind level.	0
1000496	And in my exprience, physical punishment is batter.	0
1000497	Which means teachers have rights to punish students who ruin their class and who don't have attitude to study hard, But of all the punishments, physical ones can make a problem and hurt students.	0
1000498	And these informations are update to the Internet, and everyone can get them, Which means serious invasion of privacy.	0
1000499	I met my best friend in high school.	0
1000500	In Saturday, I usually go to a public library or theater.	0
1000501	There is no excuse for allowing physical punishment, even in schools.	0
1000502	I prepared to enter the Yonsei university at that time.	0
1000503	bannig smoking in all public buildings is annoying that group.	0
1000504	For example, teachers can be educated by expert of field of kid's own feeling and mind.	0
1000505	Korea has interacted uncountalby with China.	0
1000506	Indirect smoking is as harmful as direct smoking.	0
1000507	so it should be fixed by means of physical punishment.	0
1000508	Although we have more powerful weapons, we can't ignore many North Korea soldiers.	0
1000509	She majored in law and taught law and society.	0
1000510	To stop this illegal consequences, administer have to put illegal-relating money.	0
1000511	That's the people who don't use their real name.	0
1000512	I pray for you.	0
1000513	the example is all students in 1-3 didn't memorize korean words.	0
1000514	Recently, some schools have already prohibited physical punishment and there occurred many problems.	0
1000515	But it's quite a pity to invest money for maintaining the human source.	0
1000516	Yes, I agree this opinion.	0
1000517	Because of the busy day, our family can't meet each other frequently.	0
1000518	In conclusion, as for the above reasons, I strongly claim that drivers of automobiles should not be allowed to use cellular phones while their driving.	0
1000519	Therefore, it would be much better idea that banning smoking in all public buildings than doing nothing.	0
1000520	Actually, every time we are driving, there is big possibility of dangerous accidents to happen to us!	0
1000521	Therefore, I can tell him some problems in studying, making girl friends, etc..	0
1000522	But should ALL Korean men have to complete military service?	0
1000523	Because, when I was third grader, everybody in high school didn't have much time on playing outside with physical activities.	0
1000524	Also, animals are treated the best during the experiments, so people do not have to claim about the cruelty.	0
1000525	However, I like to meet my friends and think that social activity is impotortant thing, so try to go outside and take time with people.	0
1000526	Builbing is not park.	0
1000527	Shang Hai was big city than I imagine.	0
1000528	Smoking is bad for our atmosphere too.	0
1000529	Unless smoking is banned in public buildings, there will be a lot of patients from smoking.	0
1000530	Our given name is just given when we were born, so it has a limitation that desciribing who we are.	0
1000531	So they would go to outside of the buildings, for example, to parking lots or just on streets.	0
1000532	Currently, South Korea ban physical punishment of schools, I heard.	0
1000533	So, We can learn difficult sports, like a tennis, golf, and so on.	0
1000534	I think that smoking in all public buildings should be banned.	0
1000535	My favorite subjest in high school was art.	0
1000536	We volunteered for the training program and it has been 1 year since we started to live with him.	0
1000537	I disagree about physical punishment because i had grown as that guy who always physicaly punished.	0
1000538	Then, physical punishment would not be linked with the phrase 'abuse of a child'.	0
1000539	Then we can save money and time.	0
1000540	Our life will not be so happy.	0
1000541	If the smell attach to our clothes, it do not want to go away.	0
1000542	go away".	0
1000543	We can make serious patients get better and all of the elder people can live longer than 10 years ago.	0
1000544	Today, my people smoke in many places.	0
1000545	For example, working in subway station is a form of military service.	0
1000546	Many people think that we can teach the childrens and students without physical punishment.	0
1000547	So, I try to make him relax and give some tips.	0
1000548	Also, there are better methods than physical punishment.	0
1000549	And some the other school teachers made a club for communicate with their students.	0
1000550	He is hard in the classroom.	0
1000551	I think that this meeting with other groups and experience were the most interesting one that happened to me.	0
1000552	Some people hold that people must use their real name on the Internet.	0
1000553	Past, I used to play friends, and didnt' go school, and do not study.	0
1000554	Well, except the expel.	0
1000555	So, We need to be more flexible in military service as a way of diversity.	0
1000556	you can't not believe or not, I have not a object that has special meaning.	0
1000557	So, this piano is very importatn to our family.	0
1000558	So anonymous can encourage to write a bad reply.	0
1000559	In this situation, if smoking is banned in all public buildings, many people think smoking as an irregal act, then many smokers are regarded as bad people.	0
1000560	And driver feel very sorry to walker because of his mistake.	0
1000561	First of all, people are easily distracted when using cell phone.	0
1000562	At schools in seoul, educational policy does not allow to use physical punishment to teachers to educate their students and they have to use other ways to educate them.	0
1000563	jin-sil cheoi killed herself because of rumors and da-bin jeoung suicided, too.	0
1000564	The atmosphere in the lesson will be worse and worse.	0
1000565	Because of these aspects, although he is not as smart as me and entered university that isn't so good, I respect him.	0
1000566	so I heard many part of military service.	0
1000567	I heard it has many things that Korea doesn't have and I want to feel the nature.	0
1000568	Teacher not only a person that teachs a textbook, but also a person that has a deep thinking of life.	0
1000569	No one is responsible for the opinion without name and people will not listen carefully to it.	0
1000570	i make a plan to read a book once a week.	0
1000571	If we invent new medicine for human, we need animal experiments.	0
1000572	Physical punishment of children in schools must need for children and school.	0
1000573	Someone can't live without these experiments.	0
1000574	Even though they know violent behavior is bad, they will learn violent behavior because they are teenager.	0
1000575	We make law powerful, and we need to forbidden powerfully using cellular phones while driving.	0
1000576	"But Smoking is hurt human body that co-workers and peaple in the same place.	0
1000577	Most people who use phones during driving use their hands to use it.	0
1000578	so i think people should not use animals in medical experiments.	0
1000579	Because of this, unlike other countries like The U.S. almost all men who live in South Korea must enroll in military when they get certain age.	0
1000580	I think it makes not only men but also nation uncompetitive.	0
1000581	they were just a useful system to find information.	0
1000582	It may lower theachers' social forces, which makes students be overact in their bad actions.	0
1000583	Therefore, Many teachers choose physical punishment.	0
1000584	Thus, I think we need to stop teaching by physical punishment with law.	0
1000585	In the smoking room, it must change air everytime.	0
1000586	The fool is him.	0
1000587	The result shows that children who saw violent behaviors such as their teacher's physical punishment have more possibility to be a violent adults when they grow up.	0
1000588	Some months ago, a law for students is made by the administration of the State of Gyeong Gi.	0
1000589	First, I agree with that opinion which people must use their real name on the Internet.	0
1000590	But her teaching was very good.	0
1000591	They want to make their hairs dyed and permed.	0
1000592	We rode a bus with two floors.	0
1000593	Especially, military service is very crucial duty since it is directly related to the nation's safety.	0
1000594	So if that multitasking is not neccesary, and if it can even endanger your life, I recommend not to try it.	0
1000595	First I go the place where elder people lived, hlep them washing, make them happy,and cook special food for them.	0
1000596	For that reason, applying medicine on animals before using it on patients can improve the quality and accuracy of the drug use.	0
1000597	And I felt other performs but I can't write all of the on this page	0
1000598	We can pay for that.	0
1000599	If he didn't work with that truck maybe i couldn't go to unvirsity.	0
1000600	And when we arrived at the amusement park, there was a few people in there.	0
1000601	When punishment is over, I thought 'This is not connective in score.	0
1000602	On every Saturday morning, I go to church.	0
1000603	People want safe.	0
1000604	In public buildings, there are many people: smoking people, nonsmoking people, children and the old.	0
1000605	No society teaches all of these knowledge, moral, friendship, partnership, leadership, negotiating with their friends but school does.	0
1000606	It also means if the using of phone can affect the drivers' mind, they can't handle the automobile the way they've done when day didn't use the cellular phone.	0
1000607	So put the physical punishment has bad effect to students, also teachers.	0
1000608	it causes bad things to make people unplesant about my writtings.	0
1000609	animal experience let us know complications and the proper quantity of that medicine before we use it.	0
1000610	if we think online and real world are same, it can be very dangerous problem.	0
1000611	She is always kind to everyone.	0
1000612	In political view, It is the best status that in peace and volunteer military service.	0
1000613	I played the ski.	0
1000614	That's why kids accidents is happen.	0
1000615	I change my little parrot's water, and give it some food.	0
1000616	In conclusion, Korean men's military duty is entirely necessary.	0
1000617	So they should banned talking cellular phone by other artifacts.	0
1000618	Lots of animals are being sacrificed for inventing remedies of fatal diseases.	0
1000619	But, there is the other alternative punishment of children in schools.	0
1000620	So the building should be keep clean.	0
1000621	But, in reality, we can't do this same thing in every situation like this.	0
1000622	We disagreed with the physical punishment.	0
1000623	He liked to draw things on a board to explain some of geographical things, and that helped a lot understand the subject.	0
1000624	Laozi says about non-doing.	0
1000625	About twenty years ago, no parents criticized the teachers who used the phisical punishment, but nowadays, modern parents get upset even if their boys and girls get a little bit of scar from their schools.	0
1000626	) I think in a physical way, teachers may hurt their hearts, and students may also hurt their hearts and bodies.	0
1000627	Celluar phones as well as alchole are most nortorious enemy to drivers.	0
1000628	Middle school and high school students are need the physical punishment.	0
1000629	If i have a chance to travel, I will choose italy without hesitation.	0
1000630	I saw some news about school punishment.	0
1000631	So I want to go to Brazil in South America.	0
1000632	So when some problem happens, we treat it in same way.	0
1000633	When Jung-Hee left Korea, Jung-Hee and I cried a lot in the airport.	0
1000634	She majors in piano and now she goes to college in Berlin.	0
1000635	So, When teachers teach that students, they are tired, sad, angry, and disappointed.	0
1000636	So drivers should not use cellular phones while driving.	0
1000637	She always raised me up when I fall in those slump.	0
1000638	Surely, if I have a family meeting, it will be my foremost thing.	0
1000639	Korea is the only country that divided.	0
1000640	If there is no animal in medical experiments, Their vacancy is filled by human and many people are died.	0
1000641	This things need very much attention even they are not using cell-phones.	0
1000642	First, Because China is close to our country, Korea.	0
1000643	They should pay the bill to cure.	0
1000644	And I want to go China because it has desert and silk road.	0
1000645	Since he was my homeroom teacher when I was in second grade, he talked a lot with me.	0
1000646	In my diary there are many episodes that I experienced.	0
1000647	This can be presented as a war between South Korea and North Korea.	0
1000648	If I write it, I show my information and then I do not have a freedom anymore on the Internet site.	0
1000649	And smokers is not always in public building, so they should wait until go out.	0
1000650	First, I like the humourous aspect of my best friend.	0
1000651	It is because human's responsibility is dramatically reduced when they have certainty that their bad behavior will not be known.	0
1000652	This also give me energy.	0
1000653	For these reasons, I would choose Newzealand for the first country to visit.	0
1000654	First of all, all animal experiments have some reasons.	0
1000655	Lots of researchers results proved that using cellular phone in driving car or motercycle is worse than driving in drunk.	0
1000656	I think job soldier is proper replacment Military service demands every man to spend their expensive years.	0
1000657	longtime ago i visited the Europe. and I arounded France, Italy, Switcheland.	0
1000658	In this vacation, I experienced the most sad thing.	0
1000659	I want to sip coffee with watching people walking.	0
1000660	In the recent society, students barely exercise.	0
1000661	They bought the tree when they married.	0
1000662	The america have so many league and I like sports very much and I want to see every sprots in america.	0
1000663	He was biology teacher.	0
1000664	However, I think drivers should be allowed to use cellular phones because of two reasons.	0
1000665	It is the first present that he give to me.	0
1000666	and this way will be very wise way to accomplish korea's unification.	0
1000667	I usually play soccer at our high school.	0
1000668	After that I spend the morning reading or watching a movie until dinner time.	0
1000669	No, I do not agree with it.	0
1000670	And he works very hard to acheive his goal.	0
1000671	In that situations, the only one I can trust was my friend.	0
1000672	Some might say that they need to respond to their phone calls for business purposes and some other urgent reasons.	0
1000673	No children want to be physical punished.	0
1000674	I don't know much about whether Korea-Town is there, but if I can eat my favorite Korean food, like Kimchi, in Island, I will make a noise with most loud voice as I can make.	0
1000675	Some celebrities or upper class people try illegal method to avoid military service.	0
1000676	Because it has ultimately challenging parts, such as Statistics, Probability, Integration etc.	0
1000677	We have taken a lot of pictures whenever we go travel or just go out and that is because we want those memory not to be forgotten or fade away.	0
1000678	If they do not go to the army and work hard in their own way, the country will get better.	0
1000679	I`m going to open my mind to God gradually.	0
1000680	By that reason, DCinside became the very first site of almost every rumors or gossips of entertainers start.	0
1000681	Yes, Animals is alternative selection.	0
1000682	As a result, the real-name-use system on the Internet can help people decide something frankly and seriously.	0
1000683	In order to prevent this dangerous situation, we would better use real name.	0
1000684	So when i was riding my bike my family always nervous.	0
1000685	Then people will begin to seek for peaceful online world.	0
1000686	So we can make dangerous accident, too.	0
1000687	And to alert this to people, media should help.	0
1000688	YOON very much.	0
1000689	So many people use Internet and everybody can access to you.	0
1000690	Netizens can't express their thoughts and ideologies which are not allowed in this society liberally such as communism because expressing and talking about those are illegal.	0
1000691	punish ment score law is not temporary.	0
1000692	In other words, teachers' authorities lose the power and students are being out of control.	0
1000693	First, many teachers have a hard time to take care of their students without physical punishment.	0
1000694	Other than using animals, we should make very highly sensitive, developed mechanic devices to test medical experiments.	0
1000695	But most teachers didn't try to find other way to contorol children.	0
1000696	If government allowed that teachers should do punishments when students are not straight, that problem is clear i think.	0
1000697	And nobody should neglect his responsibility.	0
1000698	He told me that just awesome.	0
1000699	Trip to Dong-Hae was so fantastic.	0
1000700	Using real name means we have a right on the Internet. if people don't doing that not allowed, it should be punished whatever real name or fake name is.	0
1000701	It was always very important thing in the making medicine course.	0
1000702	we usually football game.	0
1000703	so the most special thing for me is our plants.	0
1000704	Physical punishment is just for one student, but punishment for adult can affect to his or her family, friends, and even their company.	0
1000705	Especially third-smoking is more dangerous.	0
1000706	When I write it, I can tell my real feelings and thinkings.	0
1000707	Debating freely and exchanging ideas are vital parts of academic activities when it comes to education of children.	0
1000708	But it will help to catch the person who do bad act several times and to protect many people's privacy.	0
1000709	Second reason is teacher.	0
1000710	Dotor said that was the miracle.	0
1000711	One more thing that I think men should complete it is there are many parts in military, so men can choose their own parts.	0
1000712	And i want to be a composer, and my roll model is Chopin, so I go to the Poland, and I want to know about his history, and his country.	0
1000713	Thus, it is easier for me to spend my time with my family on Saturdys than time when I have to go to a school.	0
1000714	After my parents heard this situation, they rushed to me.	0
1000715	You cannot help concentrating on because your entire nerves are toward to every pieces of car.	0
1000716	If i have a chance to travel, I want to go to the Poland at first.	0
1000717	I am proud of it.	0
1000718	Unlike my other friends, my best friend tries to know how I feel.	0
1000719	I can forget my bad memories, awful experience.	0
1000720	Humans are the strong because humans can use tools to survive.	0
1000721	At the same time, there are many various people in the public buildings than normal buildings.	0
1000722	First, in conclusion, I think that it is necessary to use people's real name on the Internet.	0
1000723	I was surprised the first time that I read 'flower' in high school.	0
1000724	Every year, a lot of people die due to car accidents and one of the most death causing factor is driving.	0
1000725	Because I don't want to spend my 2 years of 20's life in military where I have to use my physical force extremly and make my brain dumb just becaus of the fact that I'm a guy.	0
1000726	For example, while using a cell phone if the driver missed red or blue lights and the other car comes and crashes or walker suddenly shows up in front of their car.	0
1000727	I think that drivers of automobiles never be allowed to use cell phones while driving.	0
1000728	So I read many books about it and study it hard.	0
1000729	Guide line for the punishment that allow punishment, not a harsh physical one, but some proper actions to their behaviour, which can be accepted to teachers, students and parents.	0
1000730	I think it's vacation trip to Jeju Island with my family.	0
1000731	That time, He lived too far to come to my house.	0
1000732	Secondly, I like her because she is so kind and genorous.	0
1000733	In that case, he spoiled a dream of one little girl because he wanted to little bit more convenient way just for himself.	0
1000734	He made me laugh while I was studying it.	0
1000735	Additionally, this measure can get more power in Korea, because Koreans have big education heat.	0
1000736	I disagree that peeple must use their real name on the Internet.	0
1000737	i like math teacher.	0
1000738	Because teachers are same human as students.	0
1000739	But many people have already used their own name in internet.	0
1000740	Such as raise their pay at military, plus point at their resume.	0
1000741	It's tiring and boring sometimes.	0
1000742	I participated a lot of concert, played cello with the famous singer, Soo-mi Jo, entered the orchestra, and won a lot of prize.	0
1000743	I was also with them.	0
1000744	These days, internet is becoming stronger and as a result of it, there are several social problems caused by internet.	0
1000745	One of troublesome problems in modern society is inappropriate relationships developed through Internet.	0
1000746	But, I disagree with them.	0
1000747	I just opened my mobile phone and checked it, which was harshly accused by my driving tutor, because I was likely to hit the next car, losing my attention.	0
1000748	I cannot forget the night of that day.	0
1000749	There are many celebrities that sucided because of bad rumors about them.	0
1000750	On top of that, the state of Korea is unique because we are divided into two countries.	0
1000751	For these reasons, I strongly argue that all Korean men do not have to be forced to complete military service.	0
1000752	The most important reason why I think him as my best friend is his certainty.	0
1000753	Students tell that teacher is pig, and students smoked in school.	0
1000754	And women have easier life.	0
1000755	internet has already invade our life.	0
1000756	My teacher noticed the accident, she did punishment her.	0
1000757	So children can prevent bad behaviors by remembering the pain.	0
1000758	It is why I like him.	0
1000759	I like to go first to Europe, especially North Europe.	0
1000760	There are two good things about him that I like.	0
1000761	Decreasing military service period is a good example.	0
1000762	Because our community is build by respect someone's right.	0
1000763	It can make the bending between he and his students sticker.	0
1000764	Teachers are humans and they have emotion like other people.	0
1000765	I'm worried about my life especially about my university life after military service.	0
1000766	Although at now my dream is to be a fund manager, but when I was young I want to be a historian.	0
1000767	They are trained by human technology.	0
1000768	Internet should be a mean to interact each other freely but it can't work in the real name based internet.	0
1000769	When students do wrong, teachers give score, not punishment!	0
1000770	My friends makes me funny and comfortable.	0
1000771	First If schools not haven't physical punishment That school's studens don't think any school's rule and They don't need teacher anymore.	0
1000772	If I get a chance to travel abroad, I'll definitely visit Newzealand first.	0
1000773	I like history because history gives me an answers about the questions I always wondered.	0
1000774	Teacher can use other punishment like extra reports or detention but student do not think it seriously and they will make same mistakes again and again.	0
1000775	Education is not one side acting, it needs interact of teacher and children.	0
1000776	If physical punishment is not allowed in classes, students will not listen to the teacher's instrucions more.	0
1000777	In this vacation, my family got much closer, and made special memories with each other.	0
1000778	first, smokers already spend money for smoking tax when they buy siggarets.	0
1000779	For young students, love and kind of teacher is the most important thing in school days.	0
1000780	When I am 13 years old, My father and mother give me a cross.	0
1000781	But it is same that those inventions disperse consentration.	0
1000782	middle school student can't accept that damage and have very bad memory.	0
1000783	During 3rd grade in highschool lot of students sufur from stress because of studying but I didn't.	0
1000784	but I met my math teather, and my math grade was increase quickly.	0
1000785	I like diversity and thinking outside the box.	0
1000786	This way, we can have safe road for everyone.	0
1000787	Although some drivers of automobiles's cellular phones are necessary and using cellular phone is liverty, but I think people's life is most important thing.	0
1000788	fishing is bord.	0
1000789	It is natural.	0
1000790	When I am sad, I can be happy as I see the comic movies.	0
1000791	Among them, there are proper physical punishment.	0
1000792	But unlike other ordinary habits, smoking affects many other people who have smoking habit and don't have.	0
1000793	I can talk about my inner feelings with him and he also can talk about his thoughts.	0
1000794	Because his face is red.	0
1000795	But we can see people who volunteer military service.	0
1000796	So it was really disappointing when he was too sick to say something about himself.	0
1000797	My favorite teacher is "Do Tae-Il" who teach the math in my high school.	0
1000798	If this was being implemented early, people's health and environment would be much better than nowadays'.	0
1000799	So I felt that I grew up more bigger.	0
1000800	Of course, forbiding smoking is very angry to smokers, and stopping smoking is stressing, not easy, so in this stress, they can smoke more than ever before.	0
1000801	Third, there are a lot of better ways for punish children than physical punishment.	0
1000802	I do not agree with the physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1000803	Because of this trend that some men try to exempt from the service, it is controversial in Korea whether all Korean men should be required to finish military service.	0
1000804	What if someone dies because of gas?	0
1000805	The lack of communication between them is thought as one reason why physical punishment is spreaded wide.	0
1000806	In fact, I do not know the correct answer to this question.	0
1000807	I don't agree with the idea.	0
1000808	This right is neccessary because the teacher must have the way of controlling their student properly.	0
1000809	The most severe problem is people think they can do everything because they think other people in the internet can't who they are.	0
1000810	Secondly, if our medical technology develops, it can save lots of animals.	0
1000811	Physical punishment, however, can't give students the chance to think about their misbehaviors in the quiet manner.	0
1000812	So, not only for society, but also for every single person, I think it is essential.	0
1000813	so I can high record in exams.	0
1000814	If I achieve my goal, I also may use animals in experiments.	0
1000815	And I thought that teching is very meaningful after seeing my students are focusing on me eagerly.	0
1000816	If I need a embracement, they give me the embracement.	0
1000817	Children need to be aware of there is punishment if they go too far.	0
1000818	I don't want to be a subject'.	0
1000819	Althouh comleteing military service is hard and threatend our life.	0
1000820	I used to work in academy that teach math and english and korea to high school student in the academy I make quite and good mood for student to study alone.	0
1000821	He was my first homeroom teacher who was man.	0
1000822	It is just "easy" way.	0
1000823	Second, smoking makes trash.	0
1000824	As the technology of cell phones got developed, Major companies such as Apple and Samsung made smart phones.	0
1000825	All public buildings is not owned by one smoker, so smokers have to smoke outdoors.	0
1000826	But in my favorite website, people do not use real name.	0
1000827	I believe animals should be used in medical experiments to a certain degree.	0
1000828	They are not skillful.	0
1000829	For example, when we have created a new type of drug which can cure disease, we have to test it on animals before applying it for human.	0
1000830	The rumors use the fact and rules, 'do not have to use REAL NAME on the internet'.	0
1000831	Until last November, I had no purse because I had nothing to get in purse.	0
1000832	So animal experiment is natural human's act.	0
1000833	They choice the military term free so they do their best during the military service.	0
1000834	I agree that people should use their real name on the Internet.	0
1000835	we have to have grateful mind to animals.	0
1000836	That is, when we banning the physical punishment by law, some teachers do the same.	0
1000837	Besides, He is really funny and he is trust person.	0
1000838	Because many people speak bad things to them, but they can`t withstand that.	0
1000839	As Internet is developing every year, Privacy became one of the most important value that must allowed to everyone in the world at recent time.	0
1000840	I think it's win-win policy.	0
1000841	They say the using cause traffic accident, that cause accident of somebody, that is loss of our society.	0
1000842	It shows that the cellphone is the reason of car accidents.	0
1000843	Therefore, I had many experiences with our car.	0
1000844	However, if that freedom harms other peoples' lives, it is not just, and it should be restricted.	0
1000845	But if that writing harms some people, it has to emiliate.	0
1000846	Because they exist in High school, I survive in there.	0
1000847	But we really need.	0
1000848	The government can choice either the former or latter, but outcome will be different each other.	0
1000849	But these days, many singers and actors killed themselves because of Internet.	0
1000850	Physical punishment also has many disadvantages.	0
1000851	That helps me meet other people and gives me a new point of view to look other things.	0
1000852	I play with them, talk with, and travel with them.	0
1000853	Nowadays, many people use internet.	0
1000854	Our country is in a very difficult situation as a military.	0
1000855	It should not be taken to give life to some other one.	0
1000856	We are not able to connect to other peple and that situation can be used badly to control our liberties.	0
1000857	I agree and understand nowday's students are hate physical punishment becaus it makes them upset and they think their body is most precious thing.	0
1000858	Yes, they should.	0
1000859	Because of the responsibility, they won't blame on other people(someone in the internet sites), whom they don't know well, without any proof.	0
1000860	But it's not cool.	0
1000861	Because France is best place to travel.	0
1000862	Because people made law that says it's wrong to kill someone for any reasons.	0
1000863	We could familiar, He thought me best friend too.	0
1000864	It's can be frustrated to both smoking people and non-smoking people.	0
1000865	So every driver, no matter how good their abilities or how safe their situation, should not use cell phone while driving.	0
1000866	It is same that Japan did to Koreans early mid-1900s called maruta.	0
1000867	Second, second-hand smoking influences other non-smoking people and it is more harmful than people who smokes.	0
1000868	I want to see the game in there.	0
1000869	The point that we have a lot of common thing is why I like him.	0
1000870	Thank you.	0
1000871	I like doing shopping clothes and shoes.	0
1000872	And when I entered YONSEI UNIVSITY, She called me and scream!!!	0
1000873	Regardless of that I really don't like it, smoking would be the world's most harmful behavior.	0
1000874	Then why i like chemical is beacase of this subject's infinity.	0
1000875	According to the research of one science researcher organization, second hand smoking gives more damage to health than direct smoking.	0
1000876	And after they die, we must bury them with respect, not throwing them away in trashcan.	0
1000877	In February I start tutoring.	0
1000878	After meeting my sister at the airport, we directly went to Disney World at Los Angeles. there were many amazing things like very very large candy shops and souvenir stores.	0
1000879	For example, her nate friend count is 300 but mine is 100.	0
1000880	I agree.	0
1000881	However, young boys and girls can repair their rude actives easily.	0
1000882	the number in mathmetics is same in all country.	0
1000883	i don't learn to drive.	0
1000884	At first, It is very hard, but time goes on, It is very fun.	0
1000885	It can give children that their last behaivor was not good one and shouldn't do that again.	0
1000886	So when arriving the test room, I was refused to go the place because I didn't have my provement.	0
1000887	Sometimes it can kill many people.	0
1000888	He has some anger that has girl out and push up.	0
1000889	My favorite teacher was a biology teacher.	0
1000890	It is an immature thought of human beings, thinking that they are on the top of nature's living creatures.	0
1000891	Our relationship starts in respectation.	0
1000892	These goodness makes me have pride that I have this great friend.	0
1000893	I think using real name on the Internet is best solution for the problem, though, it isn't still enforced well.	0
1000894	At finally they choose commit suicide.	0
1000895	I know that most of smokers don't do like my friends.	0
1000896	Many people feel hurt by others ridiculing and abusing them.	0
1000897	Especially about the forces and objects, I say it's "instictive" thinking.	0
1000898	And 1970's there are so many phsical punishment in school that every student thinks punishment is duty of the students.	0
1000899	We have to abolish this violent action and try to seek better ways to teach which can affect childen positively and respect each one's human rights.	0
1000900	because in the end, he know why teacher punished him and how teacher love him.	0
1000901	Althogh the doll is very old, it is very precious to me.	0
1000902	He encouraged me to try harder in my difficult time.	0
1000903	And I still contact with friends I made from there.	0
1000904	But, this statement could sound like results can justify the methods.	0
1000905	But my family and I always get up at 6, then we go to the indoor gym.	0
1000906	Consequently, physical punishment is not needed in elementary school.	0
1000907	Also, if smoking doesn't ban in all public buildings, many people that don't smoke also damage to their body.	0
1000908	For example, I read books or surfing the internet.	0
1000909	For example, the mouse, that used for dangerous experiment with medicien.	0
1000910	As long as I can remember, there has been an argument whether smoking should be banned in all public buildings.	0
1000911	He teached me from 2nd grade and he treat me very well.	0
1000912	I think smoking should be banned in all public buildings.	0
1000913	It was one night-two days trips.	0
1000914	But if nobody in your car, you could off your phone before the driving.	0
1000915	I'm sorry for this.	0
1000916	I like consideration of my best freind.	0
1000917	when we slept almost, we got waked because of rain!	0
1000918	Many people think time is gold so they don't have to complete military service.	0
1000919	Cellular phones have a important meaning as a conversation tool in a modern society.	0
1000920	Also, cellular phone companys can install the system that can't using the phone when the phone is driving mode.	0
1000921	If they complete military service successfully, I am sure that they can live their life successfully too.	0
1000922	I think that people have to use their real name vitally.	0
1000923	We play bowling and eat dinner at restaurant.	0
1000924	Take China for instance.	0
1000925	Smoking person breath with firter.	0
1000926	When I'm back at home, I eat dinner and watch a documentary program with my family.	0
1000927	Nowadays Internet has been a everyday-media, so a lot of peole share opinions and communiate with each other through the Internet.	0
1000928	In my 2nd highschool, winter vacation was really hard time.	0
1000929	Sometimes, frantic teachers in news broke student's arms, legs.	0
1000930	And writers wrote a reply in apathy, but some reader can hurt.	0
1000931	If we follow these rules strictly, physical punishment can be effective to student's misbehavior.	0
1000932	Keeping a criminal in the prison violates the dignity so badly, but it is being used in all democratic conturies, because the criminals violated other one's dignity.	0
1000933	Because he is a really thoughtful and patient.	0
1000934	Second, If applied korean men was allowed to complete military service, many of the Koreans will be reluctant to go to army.	0
1000935	Frist it had correct answer.	0
1000936	After that, it is end of Saturday's life.	0
1000937	When they see, children study hard and being a good kids.	0
1000938	After all, car accidents should be dissappear because it hurts innocent people.	0
1000939	I walk anyware to example dipartmentstore , park.	0
1000940	If we couldn't use animals in medical experiment, we may not live in the earth right now.	0
1000941	Some men who are not forced to that service are more perfect than other Korean men who be forced to.	0
1000942	And many students don't hear the words of their teachers.	0
1000943	Finally our medical care development is stop and this also lead environment preservation system to stop.	0
1000944	But, in South Korea, there is no war with North Korea.	0
1000945	Also considering the number between how many we can save and how many we should sacrifice, we should say it is necessary-evil.	0
1000946	Firsh of all, In recent knews, There are many students who disregard their teacher because teachers don't punish these students.	0
1000947	After he came home, our family members stopped highing voices, and we had more chances to talk each other.	0
1000948	The reason was that experience triggered by phycisal pain made smokers and "possible" smokers endure the desire to smoke.	0
1000949	So make effective treatment for deviation and use it to control the students.	0
1000950	We both love comic books like 'One-piece'.	0
1000951	My favorite subject when I was in high school was math.	0
1000952	Men has the strength for save, and women hasn't.	0
1000953	When we are talking, I feel that my friend really concentrates on me and he is really cool.	0
1000954	He puts a lot of effort to make us happy.	0
1000955	Although I agree with the idea that useing phones while driving is dangerous and can cause accidents, not allowing can be more dangerous and also can cause accidents because of two reasons.	0
1000956	I've split up myself, and fall from the mount many time.	0
1000957	First, it can prevent personal attack happening behind the name of ID.	0
1000958	In other words, strong physical punishment might harm student's authority, but little and educational punishmenet can make positive effects in a long sight.	0
1000959	This pen is not special form, not expensive.	0
1000960	This is because these days people's relationship is very complicated.	0
1000961	I think this drives many people to be a victim of car accidents.	0
1000962	And many useful and practical technics are born.	0
1000963	If this goes well, I think we can make more friendly society and can live good lives.	0
1000964	She says in this time, some student is so lude and very hard to take care and autually I feel too some situation.	0
1000965	There always are some outlaw.	0
1000966	By doing this, the person's privacy could not be existed anymore and his or her personal information is disclosed by someone that he or she doesn't want.	0
1000967	It is like giving a water to the students like sponge.	0
1000968	But now, we need more strength to put up with other advanced countries.	0
1000969	And furtheremore, I think smoking should be banned in all location, except like home.	0
1000970	First of all, By banning smoking in all public buildings, both smoking people and non-smoking people can be healthy.	0
1000971	For example, blame other people blindly, behave unappropriately.	0
1000972	And we all have rights to be happy and preserve our health.	0
1000973	If children absorb the smoke, it can be more dangerous than when adults absorb the smoke, because children lack immune ability.	0
1000974	First, physical punishment can be a good way of caring and leading students in right ways.	0
1000975	That acting is very satisfactory.	0
1000976	Some people argue that all Korean men doesn't need to complete military service, because during completing the military service, men can't study, earn money and work in society so this period could be waste of time for men.	0
1000977	It would lead to adolescent smoking and adult smoking.	0
1000978	The thing which should not be allowed is physical punishment misuse, not physical punishment itself.	0
1000979	Children can understand teaching if teachers tell their bad thing.	0
1000980	But some teachers claimed this action would take away teachers' power and dignity.	0
1000981	Someday students graduate the school and study by themselves.	0
1000982	Every time I felt it's to late to study, I got anxious.	0
1000983	I like 'Chelsea' the English soccer team.	0
1000984	If Republic of Korea makes military service like an iron, our villians never defeat our nation.	0
1000985	Even It needs our big effort, It will give us a good Internet writing background and the right Internet culture.	0
1000986	Students are not old enough to control by themselves.	0
1000987	If i say that, other people think me curse, but it is compulsory behavior.	0
1000988	Buy the way I can speak japanes.	0
1000989	it always cause many people to conflict their opinon.	0
1000990	She always finishes all things on time.	0
1000991	First, we use computers very often for hobbies.	0
1000992	nowadays this things very often, we can see this TV, internet and newspaper and so on.	0
1000993	What happened in YonPoen	0
1000994	That was my 3-grade of the high school and She was a main teacher of my class.	0
1000995	Although there is a risk which some people use to their goal, There are thing which we must ignore	0
1000996	And it can make a lot of side effects and even they can die becase of the inappropriate experimental care.	0
1000997	Indeed, it is possible to diminish car accidents and live in extemely more safe society.	0
1000998	Schools have very important responsibility to make students work hard.	0
1000999	I would like to visit england if i have a chance to travel.	0
1001000	The Second singer I found is 'Gukkasten'.	0
1001001	Second, it is only diffrenties of place where we stand.	0
1001002	And that sure does not mean their children are more impolite or less educated.	0
1001003	Smoking people is important as non smoking people is.	0
1001004	It's the same words to that we have rights to make people safe.	0
1001005	However if they are being treated equally in the physical punishment there will be a lot of dissaproval from the students.	0
1001006	So, I think the physical punishment's positive effect is so large that schools must accomodate it as soon as possible.	0
1001007	especially babies are so weak and sensitive.	0
1001008	I think that animal also has a feeling.	0
1001009	Today, we live in the environment that our children can act badly.	0
1001010	when the exam started, the exam was not what i think about.	0
1001011	But, if teachers solved the problem with not physical punishment but conversation, student would solve other problmens wiht conversation, not physical behavior.	0
1001012	So i like math since i was young.	0
1001013	My favorite subject was economics.	0
1001014	In other word, using real name on the Internet can not solve cyber problems.	0
1001015	That guitar, which made my grandparents work even harder selling fruits, became mine about 3 years ago, when I told my father that I wanted to learn guitar.	0
1001016	Second, forcing all Korean men to complete military service require so much cost.	0
1001017	If their life is imfortant either, we should ask agree with animals for experiments.	0
1001018	Because he still have bad smoke and bad components of cigarette with him.	0
1001019	To send all Korean men military is totally insane.	0
1001020	These days, There are many rude and selfish students.	0
1001021	Our ancestors say, "Physical punishment to lovely child, a piece of rice cake to mean child."	0
1001022	They are more vurnerable to the smokes, which was never intended.	0
1001023	Distracted attention means that drivers do not concentrate on their driving.	0
1001024	But military forces do not decrease too much, because there are always people who want to save their nation and USA will help us when war is started.	0
1001025	So, all Korean men should be forced to complete military service.	0
1001026	Especially, I thought a story very impressive, about a mother whose daughter was sick and got over it thanks to her mother.	0
1001027	And there are several reasons why I support this opinion.	0
1001028	but we must teach them.	0
1001029	They not only makes me laugh, but also inspires me a lot in that doing something hard.	0
1001030	Wherever she go, whoever they are fun.	0
1001031	So many Korean don't want to go army.	0
1001032	in addition, he told he's student how he think about history event such as french revolution.	0
1001033	It is like my friend cuz it is smart phone, i can a lot things when i'm alone home or waitting for my (real) friends.	0
1001034	Mong are issued in mess media because of their misbehave to miss the millitary service.	0
1001035	So I disagree that people must use thier real name on thr Internet.	0
1001036	So my conclusion is...	0
1001037	Meeting poor people and giving them hope are the things that i've really wanted to do when i got into university.	0
1001038	Many items in activitys is derived from China.	0
1001039	If smoking employees feel anxious about being excepted to their working areas, and then they don't accept the rules and ignore, "Legal Smoking Area" system would be gone to trashcan in a month.	0
1001040	Also, the exotic animals in the wild nature are one of the reason why I wanna go to Austrailia.	0
1001041	Not all people in public buildings are smokers.	0
1001042	Humans are not master of nature, humans are just one species of nature.	0
1001043	And also, educational government can make the special contacting room.	0
1001044	I think amry has many spcial thhings and many special experience.	0
1001045	Because they are not fully concentrate on driving.	0
1001046	We can't deny that we exploit on animals and kill them for develping and improving our health.	0
1001047	My mother likes there because the grocerys is very cheap and has good quality.	0
1001048	When they were punished, they feel very distressed and sometimes they cry.	0
1001049	it is very hard to smokers.	0
1001050	So more strong laws are in need.	0
1001051	Lastly, physical punishment also can make children get agressive characters.	0
1001052	because, I knew british pop first at that time.	0
1001053	But with smokers smoking around the non-smokers, they become victims of second-hand smoking, which is way more seriously harmful than direct smoking.	0
1001054	Because my Germany teacher was a very good teacher and I want to study Sociology in German.	0
1001055	But it is not a just violence.	0
1001056	For example, it is smoking that the most reason of cancels.	0
1001057	Few schools have guidelines for physical punishment however the criteria are so ambiguous that they are barely observed.	0
1001058	People should realize what is the first and what is following.	0
1001059	As we know, there are few people who listen to the teacher's words in schools and bevave correctly.	0
1001060	However, by using this, good Internet culture can be made and it will make more growth of the internet.	0
1001061	We have to break their shelters by using our real identifications and protect ourselves.	0
1001062	It can increase the possibility of occuring accidents.	0
1001063	I want that ours friendship is not dust.	0
1001064	This may sound freaky, it really happens in our every day lives.	0
1001065	As we think this problem in 'Economics', it is so unreasonable that killing many animals doesn't make so much profits as saving human beings, applying a theory of opportunity cost.	0
1001066	I have read history books and watch history TV programs.	0
1001067	It is better to make the place where we can take tabacco separated the public buildings.	0
1001068	Even if some people commited crimes, it will be easier for the police to catch those criminals.	0
1001069	It was winter in Korea, but it was hot summer in Thailand.	0
1001070	Smoking outside, but, should be considered as a crime.	0
1001071	So this trip was very interesting experience.	0
1001072	I think students can't learn from physical punishment.	0
1001073	So fun.	0
1001074	So, people will be not reveal thier opinions and facts.	0
1001075	Because he has very good temper.	0
1001076	Some people might say that if people use their own real name, private informations cannot be preserved.	0
1001077	It's terrific.	0
1001078	First, physical punishment ignores human rights of student.	0
1001079	In fact, I play the guitar since I was in middle school.	0
1001080	so at first I afraid of her.	0
1001081	So she went to our class and said, "Go up to the desk and hold your hand up-rising!"	0
1001082	That day i was so desappointed.	0
1001083	However, there are lots of people who abhor the mere smell of cigarette.	0
1001084	Those are very dangerous.	0
1001085	Think about it.	0
1001086	According to the recent study, using cellphone for drivers makes their ability for finding obstacles low.	0
1001087	In that time, it was important to teach more skills to live on, and teach more knoweledge to go to higher grade.	0
1001088	I disagree with physical punishment in all schools.	0
1001089	It can hurt teacher's feeling too.	0
1001090	I think that they make me to want to go america.	0
1001091	That hard time, the teacher gives me a very lot of help.	0
1001092	Secondly, physical punishment should be allowed for the authority of teachers.	0
1001093	The purpose of this rule is that to upgrade effectiveness of the company.	0
1001094	And my high school's science teachers were also great!	0
1001095	For instance, in the United States, it is verified the bad effect of using cell phones while driving.	0
1001096	We used to play baseball in middle school.	0
1001097	Also, it is special to me because my father bought it for me that I enter in Yonsei University.	0
1001098	I think physical punishment should be allowed in all schools.	0
1001099	And government also have to educate young kids to use the Internet correctly.	0
1001100	However, I hold that physically punishing is often required for the following two reasons.	0
1001101	The 21st century happens to be a time when human rights are praised above all virtues.	0
1001102	For that, the teachers have to be educated about how to punish the children in right way.	0
1001103	Generally, those places require nothing but a little sense of humor.	0
1001104	He is an expert at using queen and bishop.	0
1001105	On top of that, we can study more hour and we could grow up our exam result.	0
1001106	So physical punishment should be allowed in all schools but not hard punishment.	0
1001107	But this is so dangerous attitude in driving.	0
1001108	Therefore, Considering all these reasons that all the people have the same right and physical punishment is not the current flow worldwidely and that we can take more better actions than physical punishment, it should not be permitted in all schools to practice this wrong law.	0
1001109	I will take her everywhere until I die.	0
1001110	My favorite teacher in my high school was my homeroom teacher.	0
1001111	Physical punishment is a savage policy done to pure young guys by adults.	0
1001112	Second, he is good at most of sports like soccer, basketball and badmintoin.	0
1001113	What is military for?	0
1001114	Considering those things I explained above, I think physical punishment should be admitted for both students and teachers.	0
1001115	That seems to make a sense.	0
1001116	I would like to go England, if I have a chance to travel because at first, I love to watch soccer game.	0
1001117	Most children are openminded.	0
1001118	Teachers know other ways well.	0
1001119	The time that the students and teacher should respect each other is coming.	0
1001120	So, for this reasons, I disagree with the physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1001121	But If some one start to smoke (It have not to be many men Just only one man) the place that must be peaceful place turn to hell to non smokers.	0
1001122	we run in mauntain, so very tired but happy.	0
1001123	Physical punishment usually act in front of many friends.	0
1001124	So I really love them.	0
1001125	If they saperate their attention using them, the drivers who use their phone will lose their alertness.	0
1001126	So all men should go millitary to get some fruitful and precious skills which is useful to your own life, unless the war.	0
1001127	Yes, it must be banned.	0
1001128	if we do our best for ourselves with a lot of interest and effort, this problem will be solved.	0
1001129	In Korea, prisoners who santanced to the death are living in the prison and they will die in prison unless some laws are recorrected.	0
1001130	Second, we can make cleaner Internet culture.	0
1001131	There are a lot of examples that the cyber crime did affect the real life.	0
1001132	And also he was taken physical punishment to me.	0
1001133	So I could learn more easy what he tried to give us about study and knowhow of life, and so on.	0
1001134	I liked it because in music calss, students could learn music theory and wanted to talk about variety of sounds.	0
1001135	Then, how about letting women go military and do some works?	0
1001136	When I have to eat dinner, I go home and eat dinner.	0
1001137	But the doctor should do some animal experiments.	0
1001138	First, physical punishment invades personal rights of students.	0
1001139	Also we can make real friends by using our name on the internet.	0
1001140	On anti-physical punishment side, they say that if a student who did wrong thing has a punishment physically, he or she may be afraid of going to school and may get bad grade in pain of getting punished that way.	0
1001141	They hate the pain.	0
1001142	It is impossible to experiment all medicine on human or to just skip experiments.	0
1001143	but he never kicked or slapped me when there were no problems or matters.	0
1001144	People want private space.	0
1001145	If there anything wrong with his arguement, there is no reason not using his real name.	0
1001146	There are many advantages and disadvatages to use animals in medical experiments.	0
1001147	and when I'm heavy my life, I will meet my math teacher	0
1001148	One of reasons why we have good healthy and medical infra and enviormant is our test to animals to test to human, because the medicins dose not califed.	0
1001149	so I suggest thinking if people must use their real name on the Internet, many people can know privacy of different people is false fact.	0
1001150	As It reveals to other person, the person may use the information badly.	0
1001151	I think a person's life is more valuable than animal's.	0
1001152	It is a widely known fact that indirect smoking is more detrimental to the human body than direct smoking.	0
1001153	As I study the ethics, I was getting more excited because of academic achievement concerned with learning other people's thought and adapting it in reality.	0
1001154	so if somebody hurts something, the hurts must come back to the person.	0
1001155	although i am not good at playing soccer, i want to see the play of famous soccer player.	0
1001156	For example, I go to the dentist twice at a month.	0
1001157	Also, physical punishment is economically waste of time and enegy.	0
1001158	but i think it is interesting too.	0
1001159	And people say physical punishment is opponent to human right.	0
1001160	I wish many drivers of automobiles don't use cellular phones while driving in some days.	0
1001161	I have been permissed to come here, Yonsei University thanks to my physics score.	0
1001162	At that time, I thought I should give up studying this.	0
1001163	Though smokers insist that they have freedom of right to smoke, non-smokers also get the right to have clean atmosphere around them.	0
1001164	Obviously, it would not to be too great an exaggeration to say that the physical critics is not useful things and shoud be restricted.	0
1001165	The point in this controversy is that between the right of smokers and non-smokers, which right should be concerned more.	0
1001166	It distracts driver from driving and will cause accidents.	0
1001167	There are many animals too.	0
1001168	In reality, I heard about students who bother teacher and against teacher.	0
1001169	This is called second hand smoking and some research said it is even more harmful than first hand smoking.	0
1001170	In my opinion, the use of real name on the Internet is very very important.	0
1001171	And all parent and student should understand that phsical punishment is not punishment, it is education!	0
1001172	Because they are warm-hearted friends that they can be everyone's friends.	0
1001173	At the same time it is convenient for shoppers and sellers on the online market.	0
1001174	Some people object because they think it would bring a private rights problem.	0
1001175	For example, when a student makes a lot of serious troubles or disobeys to school rules, that student can be changed by giving him a chance to discuss his problems with professional counselors.	0
1001176	For example, if someone throw a cigarette (which was yet having small flame) to trash and if there were papers and the flame went on the papers, it might cause big fire if that developes.	0
1001177	It is same in this topic.	0
1001178	Sometimes I pasted the picture of the university so I could cheer up and study hard.	0
1001179	In school, i study in self-studying room or played basketball with my friend in break time.	0
1001180	Although there are many good reasons why people prefer to use their real name on the Internet, I believe that using virtual name on the Internet is more beneficial for us.	0
1001181	usually, if he dosen't use his phone his driving, he use his two hands on handle together.	0
1001182	My family has a special tree which we call 'family tree'.	0
1001183	In 2010 my mother is fresh driver, so she did many mistakes.	0
1001184	So I can study various fields of chemistry for this experiment.	0
1001185	Second, women are weaker than men in physical point of view.	0
1001186	And we were used in medical experiments for stronger classes.	0
1001187	I went to ski resort with my friends this winter.	0
1001188	But now, he is lazy.	0
1001189	They should fix student's fault mentally through words.	0
1001190	Of course, some of them are not preparing.	0
1001191	because, it is similiar to man with genes.	0
1001192	Physical punishment is a quick and easy way to handle children for teachers.	0
1001193	So they don't know each other's information.	0
1001194	However, Korea is tiny contry with small population.	0
1001195	and I have a big family so I don't want to be home when saturdays is coming.	0
1001196	Real examples of that side effects have happened continuously.	0
1001197	We taked train and go home.	0
1001198	On the internet, lots of people meet, talk, and trade with each other.	0
1001199	also he was like father to me.	0
1001200	However It is not a great suggestion for the following two reasons.	0
1001201	So it has special meaning as i think it is a part of my body.	0
1001202	But there were many criminals.	0
1001203	So I was very worried about my ski skill.	0
1001204	Becouse this is every arrange	0
1001205	Someday, I was late to the school, and I find him.	0
1001206	For instance, when I was 10 years old, my friend stole my wallet because she hate me.	0
1001207	She heard all about his terrible situation, and met his father face-to-face.	0
1001208	More of liberty of student, more of caos of classroom.	0
1001209	So I think the people who are so weak that they can't endure somking's influence themselves need legal protecting aginst smoking.	0
1001210	Singers, actors, and a lot of famous entertainers suicided because of bad reply.	0
1001211	But one thing should be changed : Environment in military.	0
1001212	Nowadays, some celebrities and people are blamed because they don't complete their military service.	0
1001213	Most of students are agree with me.	0
1001214	The purpose of these punishment is only for one thing, "Making student think correctly".	0
1001215	Also, physical punishment is not effective for students.	0
1001216	And the children watch his all doing.	0
1001217	JS park is one of the famous soccer player who born in korea.	0
1001218	but the level of physical punishment is protected becaous, if the level of physical punishment is very hard that's revers effect is more strong than that's effect.	0
1001219	I also watch TV and play computer.	0
1001220	Second, the USA is affacting a lot of countries.	0
1001221	Okinawa has a great weather like Spring.	0
1001222	In this way, cellular phones are needed to be allowed while driving.	0
1001223	I am very sad that we have to say good bye.	0
1001224	So I think there are more fights in Tell-zone than Nate.	0
1001225	So, to those students, physical punishment would make better result than mental punishment.	0
1001226	Firstly, he treats students extremely free.	0
1001227	Teachers should try to let the children know why we do this and how fun it is.	0
1001228	So i was studied really hard.	0
1001229	So when I take bus back to home, people in the bus watch me with annoyed expressions.	0
1001230	Therefore our family could go just to the near market.	0
1001231	At first it was a tough job to learn it because it was new to me.	0
1001232	Smoking in pulic buildings is unfair, harmful and can make this society sick.	0
1001233	So it can gives them traumas that can last for the last of childrens life.	0
1001234	One thing is that Military service is not mere a benevolence, and another is that we are in the divorced country.	0
1001235	i usaully hang on the frends, and play a scoccer, but i hardly study about subject.	0
1001236	And, the teacher has karisma with respect, not the physical punishment.	0
1001237	If I have a chance to travel, the country I would like to go first is Spain.	0
1001238	Similarly, people may easily lose control if they do not use real name.	0
1001239	So we must think about them seriously.	0
1001240	We can cure animals too by animal experiments, so it isn't just for people.	0
1001241	First, 'medical' is made by human, and for human.	0
1001242	but my teacher don't punished me but she give me a book.	0
1001243	As for me, I agree that human-beings use animals in medical experiments.	0
1001244	It's true.	0
1001245	But now I think the use of animals of medical experiments is.	0
1001246	However, compulsory military service should be remain for political needs.	0
1001247	Commonly in society, men believe that even though they were really hard during 2 years, to complete military service was really good experience.	0
1001248	Preserve them!	0
1001249	As a result, smoking in public place will decrease.	0
1001250	It continued three years and in 1953, each nation's representatives agreed to rest the war.	0
1001251	Our world is very big, and consists of many kinds of object: human, animals, plants, stars, etc.	0
1001252	The meaning of openness will be extincted.	0
1001253	I liked it because it was interasting.	0
1001254	these teachers should change their punish methods.	0
1001255	Therefore, the Internet, the only place people can exchange ideas broadly, should be open in anonimous way for the development of society.	0
1001256	She always smiled and led the class with cheerful atmosphere.	0
1001257	But this is too ideal.	0
1001258	My best friend is ji-ha.	0
1001259	Some people think it is over-action but i agree with it very much.	0
1001260	And people must not use different name on the Internet.	0
1001261	First, physical punishment can give children warning.	0
1001262	When she called me, I thought I would be killed by her.	0
1001263	Based on that I prepared exams and asked many things to teachers.	0
1001264	Teachers are tend to overuse their authorities and the physical punishments.	0
1001265	Futhurmore, We could make mistakes to someone such as sending important message to different person or calling her suzy while talking to jane.	0
1001266	My parents told me that there was a lot of physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1001267	I think people's health is more important than one's freedom.	0
1001268	First, physical punishment is unnecessary in all schools, because its efficiency is not so good.	0
1001269	My father are sometimes using the cellular phone while driving.	0
1001270	Sometimes I got a little hurt from what she says, but actually her frank adivices help me.	0
1001271	some people can say there are many students who don't listen teachers advice and whom can't talk with and the only way to communicate with them is physical punishment.	0
1001272	Consideration on human well being should count.	0
1001273	As vigorous fan of soccer, I went to Seoul City Hall with my friends to cheer our team.	0
1001274	Animals also can be angry and sad to be used like that.	0
1001275	It is true.	0
1001276	Because sometimes that makes a people odd.	0
1001277	And he expressed his opinions well and this helped friends to find common things with him and become familiar with him.	0
1001278	Besides conversation is still and easy understand childrens.	0
1001279	Teacher can have them to write paper of their acting and regretting.	0
1001280	It has high risk to occur an accident.	0
1001281	Thus I disagree with the physical punishment.	0
1001282	she always gives me a energy for positive life.	0
1001283	Also, even in office, smoking is banned in Tokyo.	0
1001284	Once the negative idea have had made, it is likely to happen that students don't want to go school anymore.	0
1001285	The ring was he only thing my parents had when they married since they got married without any money earned.	0
1001286	To prevent this kind of disatrous future, we need to think one more time if I or we are really caring about our kids.	0
1001287	For example, When a student interrupt his teacher by talking with his or her friend, Teacher can make the student stand up and watch around for 5 minutes.	0
1001288	All Korean men has to go to military service.	0
1001289	in Bosan.	0
1001290	absolutely not.	0
1001291	If teacher don't have power to control student, that class will be not efficient class and hard-studying students can't have nutritious class.	0
1001292	And I think not only public places, but also private buildings should ban smoking.	0
1001293	So rather than forcing all Korean man, we need more school which make real soldier.	0
1001294	For using real name on the Internet, for a long time, many people must agree this opinion and use their real name really.	0
1001295	I didn't like science or math at that time, So my grade at that field was really poor.	0
1001296	After this class we were so sorry Korean teacher But Time too late.	0
1001297	To be specific, When I see the picture,I can get out my worries.	0
1001298	So if physcical punishment was not allowed, teacher can't control student practically.	0
1001299	I learned that the frogs are actually in the state of almost frozen during the dormancy.	0
1001300	Also, there are some people who do not like others to smoke.	0
1001301	Before the bad habbits are made, misbehaviors should be fixed strongly.	0
1001302	I think physical punishment can be allowed in some situation.	0
1001303	Maybe it takes most part of the reason I like Korean History.	0
1001304	My best friend is Ji Hyeon.	0
1001305	At one time, my belt got loose and as a result, my trousers fell.	0
1001306	Also, math gives me curiosity.	0
1001307	The driver of the van was using cellular phones!	0
1001308	They decided not to smoke for their health or some other reasons.	0
1001309	I cheer him!	0
1001310	Moreover I can make many friends.	0
1001311	So thery is not 'all' but 'some'.	0
1001312	In math, I liked calculating limitation.	0
1001313	Last of all, academic advances are also in U.S.A.	0
1001314	But it is not right way to children.	0
1001315	But, If they must use their real name, they mind to talk and share these things.	0
1001316	Through the punishment, students could be better people.	0
1001317	Many people say that using a celluar phone while driving is not that dangerous.	0
1001318	That some people's egoism kill many normal people is very unhappy and terrible case.	0
1001319	And country should give them some adventages like helping silverlife, children of them, or tex matters.	0
1001320	Many people have to recognize right way.	0
1001321	She just acknowledges others for their own advantages.	0
1001322	Reasons of that are many.	0
1001323	Who have to use cellular phone should stop the car first and then use cellular phone.	0
1001324	People do fishing because their real name, adress and telephone number are not exposed.	0
1001325	The progress of medicine makes haman's society progress and overcome other crisis.	0
1001326	People who use that words do not use their real name on internet, and they think they are protected by hiding thier name.	0
1001327	Some people might think that physical punishment is not good.	0
1001328	I would not regret my choice.	0
1001329	So our family members eat diner and watch TV together at Saturday night.	0
1001330	If people take smoke, he or she can not help others, because it is not good to themselves.	0
1001331	When we don't use animals in medical experiments, good mediciine's demand by world people will increase.	0
1001332	In conclusion, I would say that physical punishment are have to be allowed in all school.	0
1001333	There are several reasons i'm against it.	0
1001334	I'd like to visit England.	0
1001335	Finally when we find the room, there is no happy thing more than this.	0
1001336	And it is same thing with experimented animals.	0
1001337	because one's right should not be sacrificed for the other.	0
1001338	And we have to save for all animals rights for they're happy life.	0
1001339	If many men are in army, men are not used when the men are essentialy needed.	0
1001340	Imposing extra pain have to be discouraged.	0
1001341	So the building may need some more intensive care to state longer.	0
1001342	Smoking Should be banned in all public buildings.	0
1001343	These are reasons why drivers must not use the cellular phone in driving; difficult of multi-tasking, dangerousness, other people.	0
1001344	I think his mental power is very strong so I can lean him.	0
1001345	Firstly, It is the most important thing for children to have a bright and positive mind.	0
1001346	She makes her schedules for years, months, weeks then practices each of them.	0
1001347	Smoking is very bad for health so many people who smoked a lot died because of lung cancer.	0
1001348	It is more neccessary than physical punishment for having citizenships.	0
1001349	I like taht things too!	0
1001350	Some people who really want to be soldier should serve for army.	0
1001351	If we want to prevent this situation, we should not allowd the punish ment in all schools When We considerate about the spritual and physical damage from the physical punishment, I think no one will agree to physical punishment because it overweighs the positive effects.	0
1001352	And he do not choose students for grade.	0
1001353	So, people should not smoke in public buildings.	0
1001354	This past vacation was a tough time to spend, because there are too much time for me.	0
1001355	But we don't know who would get a big accident.	0
1001356	With him, there are no moments that I am bored.	0
1001357	Governmnets should notify this kind of solution by using advertisement and teaching.	0
1001358	He/She look at not highway but cell phone screen.	0
1001359	I usually spend saturday with my boyfriend.	0
1001360	The biggiest thing I like about my friend is his characteristic.	0
1001361	if a student failed that test, that student will be punished.' that word made all students scary including me.	0
1001362	But we can't use our own lives for medical experiments.	0
1001363	And he is very humorous, so many students in his class liked him.	0
1001364	make smoking area in building so that smokers can smoke in that area without damaging other people.	0
1001365	I, however, disagree with this opinion.	0
1001366	First, animals make medical experiment successful, which is maybe adjusted to human.	0
1001367	Teachers might decide whether to punish students in his own perspective and there is no sure that it is right dicision.	0
1001368	On the way of going movie center, we went to Feeltong, the song room.	0
1001369	I have seen a lot of bad student, and I think they can't be stop by not useing physical punishment.	0
1001370	Peace is made of power.	0
1001371	However, only a little physical punishment like push up or running should be allowed.	0
1001372	So humans can be easily dead.	0
1001373	Smoking has no advantages and only harmful materials especially nicotines and tar.	0
1001374	it was also uncertain to regaining his speical ability after completing military service.	0
1001375	One who smokes doesn't know that other people mind his smoking.	0
1001376	But as I have tutored her, I've been to have some kind of responsibility.	0
1001377	And they can have freedom about communication with other people for driving.	0
1001378	Those picture gave me the fantasy about France.	0
1001379	My grandmother have also lived in Pohang, that's the reason my family chose this place to travel.	0
1001380	So they have high possibility of accidant.	0
1001381	Today I have a congraturation party.	0
1001382	In this process of development, medical expriments are necessary.	0
1001383	i'm happy when i swim with him.	0
1001384	Whenever they see, speak, write and listen to anything that tackles the big brother, they immediately be arrested and go to prison or die soon.	0
1001385	There are many food stores and many places that we can enjoy.	0
1001386	People can have various values, and men have rights to study.	0
1001387	The number of the smoking people will be bigger because our population is growing so the effect of spoil the earth is also growing.	0
1001388	It will be happy if I go there and experience a lot of things in America.	0
1001389	On the internet, people may carefully speak and this make people to respect each other.	0
1001390	When we play the games or sing songs, I was very excited with her.	0
1001391	In that league, there are many Famous Soccer stars.	0
1001392	suprisingly, it was my friend.	0
1001393	I think as i mention before, humans also a part of animals.	0
1001394	Again, I agree with the physical punishment of children.	0
1001395	However, here comes the problem.	0
1001396	But the students rights are not protected and respected in school, and ofcourse neither society, the world, the Korea maybe can`t improve our mental status.	0
1001397	And smokers must smoke things in smoking area.	0
1001398	Controversies over the use of real name on the internet seems never-ending since the era of the internet began.	0
1001399	we always happy.	0
1001400	He used to talk to my classmates and me about how life is going, and how we go through it.	0
1001401	So, If we want this teaching way can be effective, we must follow these following rules.	0
1001402	Only it always have fire.	0
1001403	And find the ways to use highly educated and professional young men in needed field.	0
1001404	I or many students think this 'Ah~ hitting or kicking is justice because we have a fault!'.	0
1001405	And I always dreaming to visit the statue of liberty.	0
1001406	On the Internet, people speak their own opinion on lots of political and social issues.	0
1001407	I understand teacher's difficulty in teaching.	0
1001408	and never kick or punch.	0
1001409	Cebu, Phillipine.	0
1001410	Physical punishment should be abolished for the following two reasons.	0
1001411	Rather, he gave me advice smiling whenever I met him.	0
1001412	Nonsmokers are likely to become curious about smoking if there are many smokers around them.	0
1001413	I have lived with it.	0
1001414	But I don't think that it is the best way of keeping Internet manners.	0
1001415	And I want to eat Japan's food, for example susi, ramen, takoyaki, and okonomiyaki.	0
1001416	But nowdays, We get high tecnology and equipments.	0
1001417	Our country got terrible war, the Korean war.	0
1001418	Chimpanzees or dolphins are even similar with brain level of human.	0
1001419	My school teacher called me and told me his email address and another students cellphone number to tell her the samething.	0
1001420	Last year though i was high school student i bought that ball to play basketball with my friends.	0
1001421	I could know our proud history and the things that we should improve for ourselves.	0
1001422	When I had chance to talk with her, I told her that I have trouble with French mojor.	0
1001423	And she is the landmark of my stupid high school time.	0
1001424	Moreover, using cellular phones while driving makes drivers' reaction late.	0
1001425	In 2009, I was second grade in high school and I was joined in Kyong-Ki-Do human's right organization.	0
1001426	One of the things that means something peculiar to my family is the Whiteboard.	0
1001427	First of all, in Paris, there are many tourist attractions such as many museums, sculptures, and festivals.	0
1001428	If there were no picture at all, we couldn't remember her clearly.	0
1001429	The fact that people can easily adapt to their environment has been proven through various experiments.	0
1001430	They can't take action alertly in urgent situation.	0
1001431	I think this mainstream should not be stopped, and finally physical punishment should be banned.	0
1001432	I like P.E.	0
1001433	Firstly, we don't have any way to replace using animals.	0
1001434	recently Celebrities kill themselves because Celebrities are exposed to the bad statements by many people who can't use their real name for just joking.	0
1001435	and Student who was consented with his teacher will be kind man.	0
1001436	It is just have a breaktime.	0
1001437	And people can help each other to make their idea better and bigger.	0
1001438	Finally, there are few possibility of wars.	0
1001439	Smoking people can smoke freely in there, and non-smoking people don't have to stress about smoking.	0
1001440	For safety and for having responsibility, it is essential.	0
1001441	I agree the latter opinion.	0
1001442	women is not stronger than men.	0
1001443	I went to eastern America, and we visited famous colleges like Harvard and MIT.	0
1001444	And then we can does medical experiments without using animals in the cyber world.	0
1001445	People say and write everything they want because people don't know who they are.	0
1001446	We must save innocent lives.	0
1001447	Ex America, UK and so on.	0
1001448	Althought we don't know much things about it, but biology subject answers that.	0
1001449	but several teachers' physical punishment lead serious hurts.	0
1001450	First, I am working as a teacher in part time.	0
1001451	He was a person like a father to me.	0
1001452	She is a cheerful girl with a pretty smile.	0
1001453	This damage will harm human's life too.	0
1001454	However school theacher do not physical punishment to them.	0
1001455	I disagree that people should use their real name on the Internet for three reasons.	0
1001456	Government spend less money using Soliders.	0
1001457	Through those Lessons, children learn that they must follow the rules in order to live as a component of a Society.	0
1001458	And thay are scared powerful people because when they state the critical opinion about the powerful people, they can take their profit away.	0
1001459	I know, because of some teachers who give hard physical punishment in school, goverment banned physical punishment in schools.	0
1001460	I write it for 2 years.	0
1001461	Samely the school give the students punishment but give not the students physical punishment.	0
1001462	Because the other can't know her or his name and address, He or she can express her or his opinion.	0
1001463	However, I strongly disagree with that argument.	0
1001464	I disagree with the physical punishment of children in school.	0
1001465	However I disagree with them.	0
1001466	I don't know very well about the punishment of children of other countries.	0
1001467	And it will harm our country and our people.	0
1001468	My favorite teacher in high school was my homeroom teacher at 3rd grade.	0
1001469	As we know, There are so many car accidents.	0
1001470	School should help student get along with all members of the society well, not teaching violation.	0
1001471	You know, every misery things are happening when you doesn't expect.	0
1001472	So teachers' authority must be promised from punishment.	0
1001473	It is Ceartin and All people must complete millitary Service but some particular people.	0
1001474	Because of this reason, Many teachers didn't punish students when they make a trouble.	0
1001475	we took many pictures there.	0
1001476	The first reason is because often drivers who talk on their phones do not use hands-free equipments, and just hold on to the phone with their hands.	0
1001477	The country I would like to go is England, especially Ireland.	0
1001478	But many people blame the girl, not her teacher.	0
1001479	It's not good for the society and nation.	0
1001480	there are two reason why I thought.	0
1001481	I was a great time.	0
1001482	So it make more people who cannot get a job.	0
1001483	There are also some movements to ban smoking in all public buildings, and I believe that this is the right thing to do, for smoking negatively affets people's health and environment.	0
1001484	Beacuse I like the susi.	0
1001485	In public buildings, smokers and non-smokers co-exist.	0
1001486	animals' ache is bad.	0
1001487	And almost every person knows cigarette smog is more harmful to indirect person than direct smoking person.	0
1001488	I once thought physical punishments should be allowed to educate student more effectively.	0
1001489	So at first, i did not concentrate on her class.	0
1001490	In conclusion, since there are some disadvantages of using our real names, I strongly argue that we don't have to use our real names in online.	0
1001491	They are killed for checking efficiency of our drugs, operation and cosmetic products.	0
1001492	Non-smokers have the right to live in a clean and healthy environment and smokers don't have the right to harm other person's health.	0
1001493	I was a kind of worried, but I was excited too.	0
1001494	She generously allowed me to stay at her house for 3 years since I was studying away from the place where rest of my families were living.	0
1001495	Governmental support is also needed.	0
1001496	At very destructive dangers like meteo srike, alien attack, rapid weather changing all of creatures can't survive without human's effort.	0
1001497	she is in China these days.	0
1001498	Some people say that not to using real name on the internet let many people more in danger,so real name on the Internet should go on.	0
1001499	Two, information taking war will take place.	0
1001500	But her teacher's react was also wrong.	0
1001501	Some might say that human right is a lot more important.	0
1001502	So going to military service when we are young yet help us Life in College, Business, and many difficult place to apply.	0
1001503	I want to be a Historican.	0
1001504	We went to a restaurant before we took the picture and had fun.	0
1001505	But I don't think that it is happened because of using a nickname that is not real name.	0
1001506	family house is the best shelter.	0
1001507	Also, it's a solution of the thinking that completing military service is only for men is not fair.	0
1001508	I hope that I can increase my French skill if I visit France.	0
1001509	Because when I solve math problems, I should think about lots of ways to solve.	0
1001510	He also helped me when I had a hard time because of the math score.	0
1001511	The school don't have any responsibility of accomodate the resistant student.	0
1001512	In my stance, I would want to be bad if my teacher scolded me and then punished.	0
1001513	But second-hand smoke also have critical harm-effect on most people and in public buildings, there are all kinds of people(kids, elderly people, sick people and so on).	0
1001514	Also, he teaches mathmatics very well.	0
1001515	He is my sun, my light, my salt.	0
1001516	So, we have to protect the rights of non-smokers.	0
1001517	As a result, the physical punishment in schools must be stopped by governments because of above reasons.	0
1001518	Second reason is that I can reflect on myself by reading materials such as novel, poetry and essay in the class.	0
1001519	Third reason is it'll probably helpful for growing the our country's medical levels.	0
1001520	When we do this, i think it is worth to do.	0
1001521	I don't like her.	0
1001522	I am vocal of my band.	0
1001523	If it's the right, then we cannot do limits on it.	0
1001524	The most important thing is non-smokers should understand smokers' desire for smoking.	0
1001525	And then that creature want to use mankind to thier experiment because they want to live longer.	0
1001526	My best friend's name is Kim Nam Jung.	0
1001527	For instance, government gives a tax reduction to the people who complete military service or additional points to company enterance exams.	0
1001528	everyday we want to live more and more.	0
1001529	But, I think, the idea that all men should go to military is not profitable in modern terms.	0
1001530	So we can sympathize many things.	0
1001531	What we need to know is that without the freedom of saying, the real meaning of democracy would be gone.	0
1001532	These days we often hear news that students behave badly to their teacher and even hit them.	0
1001533	It's funny, but it's true.	0
1001534	Because when we look this vocation realistically, we can't start this job easily.	0
1001535	It is not fair because it is decided by money and power of peole.	0
1001536	when i was in middle school, i often watched smoking friends in class.	0
1001537	Since public buildings are open to everybody, children and teenagers also use the facilities.	0
1001538	However, it is also true that Internet is used for vicious purposes such as crime and blaming celebrities.	0
1001539	when i suggest somewhere to go or something to do or some food to eat, he always says"yes" and when i was frustrated after exam, he cares me, buys foods to me.	0
1001540	I think smoking should be banned in all public buildings because of two reasons.	0
1001541	Some people say that physical punishment should not be allowed in all schools.	0
1001542	other people says that it makes strong realationship and better body.	0
1001543	I think if we use real name on the Internet, that will makes our internet more healthy and safe.	0
1001544	The way I go back to home, I do exercise like runnig and cycling in Fitness Club.	0
1001545	But using their real name can reveal their ids.	0
1001546	If the several manners is respected, the world of Internet can be filled with the brilliant idea and freedom and the courtesy mind for each other.	0
1001547	When you are driving, you can hear the importand sound around you, for example, if there happens a car accident around you, you can hear the crash sound and can alarm yourself.	0
1001548	I don't think by a rule or law(using real name) can be a real solution.	0
1001549	My favorite subject is physics.	0
1001550	We use a human in medical experiments.	0
1001551	In my opinion, people should not use their real name on the Internet.	0
1001552	They can be injured because of physical punishment and they can receive mental shock.	0
1001553	Also, he never hurried to finish or skipped chapters unless every student have fully understood that chapter.	0
1001554	I saw many interesting thing in there.	0
1001555	than, driver feel good and love their car.	0
1001556	And then, we can use the internet more carefully than now and can make the better internet life.	0
1001557	When I was young, I read a series of history comic books.	0
1001558	Yes, it's natural that if their sons or daughters get scars on their heads striken by the teachers, they might get angry.	0
1001559	So we have to respect animals' right of living and we have to reduce steadily and finally end animal using experiments.	0
1001560	The main reason of this controversy is the wrong uses of the internet.	0
1001561	I had had bicycle when i was 17 years old.	0
1001562	, then the teacher can take action.	0
1001563	He is Korea Hestory teacher.	0
1001564	And we went to Han River.	0
1001565	This side effect can be the reason of not implemeting real name system on the Internet.	0
1001566	Because of North Korea's strong military and recent attacks from North Korea, South Korea must maintain a strong military power.	0
1001567	The non smokers right must be protected.	0
1001568	In high school life, I always study hard.	0
1001569	In conclusion, I claim that we must complete it in two reasons.	0
1001570	These reasons make clear that physical punishment is the last thing teachers should do to their students.	0
1001571	I agree with the physical punishment.	0
1001572	additionally, Since ancient our society, It has been known to many people that "The physical punishment is medicine".	0
1001573	We has lived family house 15 years.	0
1001574	I will cherish the memmory that I played basketball with him.	0
1001575	In this process, students find right way to live.	0
1001576	WOW, he is the one of the best pianist in Great Britten.	0
1001577	Furthermore, students need good leaders to their life.	0
1001578	Because my major in high school was japanese, I wanted to go to Japan.	0
1001579	The government have the responsibility to try more and more to make peace for us and for themselves.	0
1001580	Some of smokers' rights can be entreached for the following reasons: health and aesthetics.	0
1001581	So we more think about other sides and future of medical problems.	0
1001582	I am sure that many people agree with me.	0
1001583	And causes big traffic jam.	0
1001584	My opinion is that peple must use their real name on internet.	0
1001585	First, smoking make the atmosphere in public buildings unclean.	0
1001586	There are some reasons.	0
1001587	We are both interested in playing soccer.	0
1001588	I have begin Taekwondo since about 9 years ago.	0
1001589	Chemistry was easier and much more interesting, so I like it and I wanted to study it more and more.	0
1001590	so It should be banned by law and who doesn't keep the law should be scolded by law.	0
1001591	In contrast it isn't proper to some students.	0
1001592	I'd like to go to England, but I don't have any chance to travel.	0
1001593	I agree with them.	0
1001594	I almost cried, but I standed it since she sat at the next side of my seat.	0
1001595	but because smopking can harm not only smokers but also non-smokers, if allowing smokers to smoke in this place there is no more people without smokers.	0
1001596	For these reasons I think the using cellular phones while driving should be abandoned.	0
1001597	They are addicted to it.	0
1001598	Second, doing tests on animals does not harm human.	0
1001599	So people must use only their real name on the Internet initially.	0
1001600	words that charging at other people can make the undersieged one to lament, sorrow, and even suicide.	0
1001601	First, I turn on the computer.	0
1001602	Women should go military, though what women do in the military would be different from what men do, and though the term in the military for women is shorter than that of men.	0
1001603	Some people say that animal is our friends and we should not using them in the medical experiment.	0
1001604	He gonna go to america, but we still best friend.	0
1001605	Then they write the replying.	0
1001606	Nowadays in Korea, it is controversial that physical puniushment should not be allowed in schools.	0
1001607	In the afternoon I play a soccer with my team and go to health club to improve my muscles bigger.	0
1001608	thank you.	0
1001609	There's one way to use animals.	0
1001610	I agree.	0
1001611	When I was highschool 2grade, I had a chance to travel, however, because of flu Going abroad was restricted by school.	0
1001612	First, there are many places to visit.	0
1001613	So drivers of automobiles must not be allowed to use celluar phones while they are driving.	0
1001614	when we do not concentrate on driving, It will make our load as a bumper car lands.	0
1001615	I think many people loves the things what they are really good at, and I also do.	0
1001616	It was so tired for coming home, but we all laugh and play games like Poker.	0
1001617	In other words, if we believe that using animals in medical tests is similar to eating animals, such experiments are not big problems.	0
1001618	First, because the children are young, they do not know their bad activities if we do not punish them.	0
1001619	Yes, I think smoking in the publick buildings should be banned.	0
1001620	On the first test, i got 100.	0
1001621	After the announcement of banning physical punishment in all schools by the government, there have been many arguments about it.	0
1001622	Everyday I write many incidents on my diary, because I can organize my day's many things.	0
1001623	Using speaking and rewards, make them understand.	0
1001624	Usually my father doesn't permit me to go far away from home so it was fantastic to go there only with my friends.	0
1001625	The government has to ban people not to use cell phone while driving.	0
1001626	But my best subject in school is always science.	0
1001627	Smoking brings about, however, some problems in terms of people's health and environment.	0
1001628	The number of smokers is getting larger.	0
1001629	The only difference is that killing people indirectly.	0
1001630	Smoking can polluted environment.	0
1001631	A is the most strong country) In U.	0
1001632	And most of public buildings there are more people didn't smoke.	0
1001633	I forgive this behavior.	0
1001634	When we play basketball or soccer, I often defeated by my friends.	0
1001635	For pedestrians or drivers who do not use cellular phone while driving, it will make them feel safe and increase their happiness that comes from the sense of being relieved.	0
1001636	Two person fighted each other using bad words.	0
1001637	But nate news section use real name.	0
1001638	Also, severe punishment can make students deviate.	0
1001639	Animal`s sacrifice can make world better.	0
1001640	but if physical punishment cannot be allowed, there's high possiblity that schools' roles are limited than allow the physical punishment.	0
1001641	Third, punished children becasue of doing wrong thing is more fair in society.	0
1001642	Therefore, using animals in harmful experiments is not right answer for medical developments.	0
1001643	but twins pitcher had a bad condition, the twins was lost until 6inigs.	0
1001644	However, he send it to different person so that professor was in problem and he was so angry to him.	0
1001645	Without the Internet, human life would not convenient like this.	0
1001646	now I and she is 20 years old.	0
1001647	one of the people that i met in the game was very annoying.	0
1001648	Human don't have any rights that treat their live right and damage their life.	0
1001649	It is sure to be spactacle.	0
1001650	when they return to university, they don't adapt his life.	0
1001651	They can also uncover biological knowledges that other researchers in the past had not yet discovered.	0
1001652	There is an example.	0
1001653	The reason why I liked this is I have a dream of being engineer.	0
1001654	I disagree with the physical punishment.	0
1001655	Military also has a function to make men better in various ways.	0
1001656	And men and women are treated fairly by military tax.	0
1001657	I said in speakingtest, I love watch soccer.	0
1001658	It could make thing worse.	0
1001659	I think this case is not reasonable.	0
1001660	The unique-name people can be targeted to others because they're so easy to find.	0
1001661	It motivated me to learn English much more.	0
1001662	So, teachers have to listen their children's telling.	0
1001663	He was the first one talked to me when I entered highschool.	0
1001664	So people in that field have to find solution.	0
1001665	He sometimes took our class to national history museum.	0
1001666	To prevent other problems that be caused by the physical punishment, we don't punish the children in schools.	0
1001667	Every time we took a trip, I when I was a baby, my father - took many pictures of my family and the beatiful scenery around us.	0
1001668	To read books which I couldn't read during week, to surfing on internet to bloging, and to go the gym to inhense my health are my favorite doing.	0
1001669	I like English because it could made me feel free in many ways.	0
1001670	so, I said to him that I don't have any talent of solving math ploblems.	0
1001671	We have to fix it.	0
1001672	It only leads a resistance from the student.	0
1001673	Some might say, then how can we protect ourself?	0
1001674	In fact, when I was young I didn't like to play the piano.	0
1001675	I want to visit germany.	0
1001676	That i think Goverment forced korean men to complete military service.	0
1001677	If you want to commet, you must use your real name.	0
1001678	Beacause mathematic is such a objective subject that it is not affected by subjective opinions.	0
1001679	Accident maked drivers hurt and people(not related driver) hurt, too.	0
1001680	It also makes other students' right to learn them disappear too.	0
1001681	Sometimes he can be my mentor, sometimes he can be my brother.	0
1001682	With this start, I study intensively about chemistry for 1year.	0
1001683	Netizen know what could happen when they bahave badly, if their names were disclosed.	0
1001684	at that time, some body should undertake them.	0
1001685	My best favorite book reading in yobo bookstore is casandra's miree.	0
1001686	I think that the rights are accepted when they can use this without bothering the rights of other people.	0
1001687	This is one of the most important thing in natioanl law, too.	0
1001688	and she invited many people who teach us helpful things.	0
1001689	Thus if nonsmokers enter the buildings, there are no ways to escape the smoke.	0
1001690	When students made a mistakes or bad actions, teachers cut their students scores.	0
1001691	I think anmals be used in medical experiments is need.	0
1001692	We can still say whatever we want on the Internet.	0
1001693	We soon graduate highschool.	0
1001694	recently, physical punishment of children in school is big isuue.	0
1001695	Hers major is physics.	0
1001696	In conclusion, I totally agree that users must use there real name on the internet.	0
1001697	Car accident gives damages not only you but also other people like other drivers, or people crossing the road.	0
1001698	I usually wake up late in Saturday.	0
1001699	Then went to church and tought student.	0
1001700	It was such a good time, and I'll never forget it.	0
1001701	Late wakeup, meet the friends, walk around, movie, computer game section, garaoke...	0
1001702	This situation go worse and critical opinions about social issues are disappearing.	0
1001703	the lake is near our home so i run lakeside road.	0
1001704	Through this course, I became interested in Korean.	0
1001705	If it is rided, teachers can't control their students.	0
1001706	(I don't like that very much.) In the future, I recall that journey is the most interesting thing that happened to me this vacation.	0
1001707	If Korean men do not have to go military service, most of them would not go military service.	0
1001708	The other reason is she and i have in common in habbits.	0
1001709	Today, crimes on the Internet are increasing and we have to take measures to get rid of those crimes as soon as possible.	0
1001710	However, in Korea, teachers need to take care of both types of educations and even for more students.	0
1001711	If they do that, both are pleasure.	0
1001712	So I like to talk with her.	0
1001713	Teacher used other punishments to bad students like 'sing a song'.	0
1001714	Although It's not because of her that I study, when I studied, what she said was my power .	0
1001715	But she was not angry with this.	0
1001716	But more important thing is that teacher should not use corporal punishment uselessly.	0
1001717	Because I like to meet friends and talk with them.	0
1001718	Shortly we should make a rule to expose our real name.	0
1001719	And situation still continues.	0
1001720	Whenever see the news scene that people use white rabbits in medical experiments, i remind my cute rabbit.	0
1001721	My favorite subject was English.	0
1001722	it is everybody knows.	0
1001723	These days, I spend my saturdays as preparing for the worship in Sundays.	0
1001724	I agree with the opinion that drivers of automobiles should not be allowed to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1001725	I love read books.	0
1001726	Somethimes, my friends call me on Saturday. and then, I would working out with my friends.	0
1001727	Also, I think smoking should be banned in all city's street and around at buildings.	0
1001728	I ususally spend my Saturdays watching TV and playing sports.	0
1001729	He teached Korean hard.	0
1001730	All public buildings don't have preparing fire system.	0
1001731	When the atmosphere got up to the pick, the vocal threw up the bottle which he drank the water in it.	0
1001732	Sometimes they are even hit their teacher.	0
1001733	when I'm 11 years old, I was walking in the crossing road in exact time.	0
1001734	By serving military service, men can not only be mentally tightened, but also physically equipped.	0
1001735	First, we can gain the safety and enhance the effectiveness of medicine and gentically modified foods.	0
1001736	Although there are no great options, maybe there will be many options to substitute that way.	0
1001737	I have been their two years ago, but I want to go one more time.	0
1001738	Thus there should be regulation that make people use real names Finally people muse be ruled to use their real names in the net for more clean society.	0
1001739	Also, while playing basketball together, friendship between me and my friends become stronger.	0
1001740	The real world says all people are equal, but there are a lot of classes actually.	0
1001741	and I talked with them about pizza.	0
1001742	I think it is not right.	0
1001743	when my friends has a closed mind, it's very difficult to talk with him and i don't want to talk with him.	0
1001744	So we recognize and loves each other, and like talking times.	0
1001745	But these day I usually spend my Saterday in watching TV.	0
1001746	When I first saw her, I didn't think that she is humorous.	0
1001747	So my opinion is that we should make rules about amounts and kinds of animals that are alowed for medical experiments, to prevent groups doing so illegally.	0
1001748	And little and little we open to each other.	0
1001749	I do not agree with that opinion.	0
1001750	It is because hitting children can be a burden to teachers phychologically.	0
1001751	We have more advanced needs than just to feed or reproduce.	0
1001752	Then punishing them with a physical pain was easy to do for us, and worked on them fast.	0
1001753	Using animals in medical experiments is not a perfect precaution of drug's side-effects.	0
1001754	Second, physical punishment in middle school and high school can be very helpful for students themselves as well as teachers.	0
1001755	I cherish this watch so much and it is very special to me.	0
1001756	Always, that teacher use punishment for good student because teacher was not good feeling day.	0
1001757	For that, the teachers should teach their students with their affection, high personality and charisma, not violence.	0
1001758	I was very interesting because I went to the middle school days.	0
1001759	Eating meat is neccesary to our health, but two behaviors are unneccesary to our health.	0
1001760	In this situation, I think that phsical punishment can be propal resolvation.	0
1001761	In child, child don't have enough understanding ability.	0
1001762	Those people who are affected by cigarette smokes are called 'second hand smokers'.	0
1001763	Some years later, we will understands society and thanks to our teachers who had punished us.	0
1001764	If Some foreign nature come to earth and use human for their medical expriment.	0
1001765	So If we prohibit their liking, It violate their right.	0
1001766	I think that smoker's right is also important as my right.	0
1001767	In now, we have another new model of video camera in home, but we still like the old one which has our family's love.	0
1001768	Also, history gives me patriotism of my country.	0
1001769	But it takes long to conform result in reality.	0
1001770	One student and a teacher have been judged by the court, because the teacher hit the student severely, so the student asserted his rights not to be hit.	0
1001771	However, I cannot agree with this opinion, because there is no educational effect through physical punishment, and capital punishment just gives tons of stress to both teachers and students.	0
1001772	However, if it practice the using people real name on the Internet, many don`t state their opinion.	0
1001773	It is not justy.	0
1001774	Apparently, receiving phone calls while driving has many benefits.	0
1001775	Some smokers may talk about their right to be happy by smoking.	0
1001776	I really desire to go facebook the most popular comany in the world.	0
1001777	I like their commercial advertisement.	0
1001778	It says the fact that Japan has their abilities and something that we must to follow them to us (KOREA).	0
1001779	The people have a right to be safe in public areas.	0
1001780	This is beacause when I had a hard time in my first grade, he gave me a lot of advice and he is always kind to everyone.	0
1001781	First, we can have much better skills of relationships between other people.	0
1001782	We live in it around 9 years.	0
1001783	But to protect other's right and make a rule which can be predicted, and applied, it is necessary not to use cell phones while driving.	0
1001784	They also have a right, and they also love students like their parents.	0
1001785	In my opinion, there must be regulations which prevent drivers from using cellular phone while driving.	0
1001786	Maybe smoking makes comfort and satisfied to some people, of course.	0
1001787	First of all, I love that subject.	0
1001788	I think that it is one method which decrease car accident rate.	0
1001789	I was very disappointed at that time, but after I grew up, I thought that He really loved our students.	0
1001790	So, because of that people, we have not to damage.	0
1001791	reason for that is simple.	0
1001792	She began some special advocating program for depressed students.	0
1001793	They started gaze us to find our wrong things.	0
1001794	Why this very good?	0
1001795	actually I spent lot of money with any thinking.	0
1001796	That is more bad for children.	0
1001797	The discrimination can follow so it can be very difficult.	0
1001798	There can be several crimes related with that system.	0
1001799	And I want to be a fifa agent.	0
1001800	The right policy is to use some part that would be needed.	0
1001801	all people in Republic of Korea has don't allow people's personal information fake from other people or mass, and also every person in Korea has right that concealing their real name.	0
1001802	But though someone commit the crime, because he uses his real name, cyber-police can easily catch this criminal.	0
1001803	But that's what we have to do.	0
1001804	Also he is the best teacher I have ever met.	0
1001805	In worst case, we will have to import foriegn soldiers.	0
1001806	And I think that the banning smoking in public buildings should be one of the regulations because many people don't like smoking and its influence to them.	0
1001807	but the student who is punished is just feel frustrated.	0
1001808	Every morning, I went to the driving academy and learned to drive.	0
1001809	Finally, this unpleasant communication mades up a vicious circle, making it even more harder to have joyful moments in school.	0
1001810	First, he is very patient.	0
1001811	It is the kind of terrible behavior in that it can make people irritated; sorry to the people if it is annoying.	0
1001812	Frankly speaking, for preparing a second university test i have no many free times last years.	0
1001813	In stead of the smoking ban in all public buildings, we can make smoking area for the smokers.	0
1001814	Even if they do something wrong, there might be reasons.	0
1001815	I think all Korean men need not be forced to complete military service.	0
1001816	He has a dream that he will be a writer.	0
1001817	I think they ought to reflect on their behavior.	0
1001818	I spend my Saturdays usually with my friends these days.	0
1001819	First of all, I like to hang out with my friends, especially my elementary school friends.	0
1001820	when it dark i go to home and sleep	0
1001821	Second is increasing price of smoking equipment.	0
1001822	We often go to play computer games in each other's house and eat pizza a lot in the same place.	0
1001823	However, it is just idealism.	0
1001824	So on Saturdays I usually sleep as much as I want to and after I wake up I go to a health club to exercise.	0
1001825	When smoking peole smoke public building, much of building's air poluted, then every people breathe hard and smells are bad.	0
1001826	I have a diary that I used in high school.	0
1001827	But i think animal experiments are too evil and it can't be any measurement for effect.	0
1001828	When l was 13 years old, l once traveled Japan with my familiy.	0
1001829	So driver must not use cellular phones while driving in their own, or police need to check of the drivers on the car, and if drivers are using cellular phones, they must take action to do not take place car accident.	0
1001830	So every time when I use this electronic dictionary I feel my mother's love for me and think I should study hard to please her.	0
1001831	Craft players in my highschool.	0
1001832	She also like to walk, play with us, so we often take her to the park to take some fresh air.	0
1001833	Third, smokings smells bad.	0
1001834	My best friend is su-ji who is my highschool friend.	0
1001835	So government set the direction of military service to the most wanted way.	0
1001836	Many research results, showing the number of accidents occured and casualties from the accidents related to cell phone using, prove us that it is dangerous to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1001837	Another student, one year younger than me, was a problem maker.	0
1001838	First, it makes students impolite.	0
1001839	Teachers need to make thier students study for their future and dreams.	0
1001840	So I believe we should minimize the number of animals that is used in medical experiments.	0
1001841	If teacher has no right and power, I think it is the death of school.	0
1001842	They should be fun but moving programs which can change the way of their lifes.	0
1001843	Because I want to enjoy that many architectures alone.	0
1001844	So we need something that can be adjusted to medicine before human's using.	0
1001845	Lastly, i had good grades on Chemistry.	0
1001846	And the problem is growing severe.	0
1001847	I think that all korean men should complete military service.	0
1001848	Little physical punishment such as indirect physical punishment can improve teacher's right.	0
1001849	I fell in love that place.	0
1001850	So everyone very sad.	0
1001851	But I disagree about their opinion.	0
1001852	So I think if physical punishment is used well, it can create many good deed and it must be good.	0
1001853	Today, we can sometims watch the news about the physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1001854	Second, we can learn society through military service.	0
1001855	they hate the teacher and the school.	0
1001856	We can punishment them about mistake.	0
1001857	Therefore we have to maintain our military budgets and military policies.	0
1001858	Any people don't predict their safe.	0
1001859	Among many advantages, the most advantages of the physical punishment of children is life's guarding of punished experience.	0
1001860	Since now I'm old enough to remeber, I want to visit England again and have a good time that I will never forget.	0
1001861	They test the substance used in experiment in many different ways and see if it would cause any problem.	0
1001862	Teacher can stop them by punishing physically.	0
1001863	Because Kyusyu locates in south, I can go there in winter.	0
1001864	I think using animals for medical experiments is very important and unskippable process in new medicine's development.	0
1001865	It would led our national safety to be threatened and moreover the presence of nation.	0
1001866	Animals play as important role as human do, so we should concider animals as equal as human.	0
1001867	In conclusion, I agree the physical punishment of children in school.	0
1001868	There's no need for you to say you're sorry.	0
1001869	I like math that time!	0
1001870	And it can leads him to downgrade his self estimation.	0
1001871	For instance, if you want to relax in a cafe, and you have to choose between the one that allows smoking and the one that does not, most people would choose the non-smoking one.	0
1001872	Physical punishment can be recognized as a violation and crime.	0
1001873	At first, his looks was not that good, but I can know that his heart was so warm.	0
1001874	All Korean men going to army is not the answer for the peace in the Korean peninsula.	0
1001875	We visited Angkor Watt and other locations, and I could feel the life of Cambodian and their culture so vividly.	0
1001876	I have a brother studying at high school.	0
1001877	In these cases, the result says the animals have been sacrificed in vain.	0
1001878	They also have very long and famous history.	0
1001879	So, smoking shoud be banned in all public buildings.	0
1001880	In addition, the main object of military is to protect our country.	0
1001881	My score in tests are always low.	0
1001882	Internet is a thing which have various aspects.	0
1001883	Because of this activites they may have many difficult problems with secondhand-smoke enviroments.	0
1001884	What teachers' most inportant work is teaching them.	0
1001885	In this regard, due to my favorite Earth Science teacher and desire to observe about extraordinary weather system, I preferred Earth Science to any other subjects in high school.	0
1001886	Because of it, men (consist me), time press is increase.	0
1001887	The bearpark was placed under the mountain!	0
1001888	But if drivers really have to use celluar phones while driving, they should set other machines for speaking which can enable them to use two hands for driving.	0
1001889	Already, many results of test show that using cellular phons with driving is very dangerous and it increases the probablity of car accidents.	0
1001890	I agree with the physical punishment of children in school.	0
1001891	Definietly, there are many rude people on internet and we have to correct this internet policy.	0
1001892	But he is not a such 3th grade teacher.	0
1001893	I even participated in Economic contest, and made a report about Economy of Korea at those days.	0
1001894	For example, the lifespan of a mouse is much shorter than that of human, so we can observe the results much faster than when we use human for medical testings.	0
1001895	They may be ambigious things.	0
1001896	Smokers should not give angry mind to non smokers.	0
1001897	On the Internet, the people using bad words to other person is a few.	0
1001898	They want to talk loudly with friends or watch DMB without ear phone.	0
1001899	First, many anonymous users trick and fake other users.	0
1001900	For this reasons, I think that not being allowed to use cellular phones while driving have a justification.	0
1001901	They will find the place that they can smoke hardly if the smoking is banned in public buliding.	0
1001902	And there, big problem isn't appear which is considered.	0
1001903	now, I don't play baduk because I learn high school studies, but I love it.	0
1001904	there are a lot of problems in military service system.	0
1001905	That makes me think again and again.	0
1001906	He was also my best friend's friend.	0
1001907	Privacy, which is one of delicate matters of today, can also be threatened by such a regulation.	0
1001908	The principal of the school, teachers and students need to make rules together for schools.	0
1001909	So, as there is no reasonable compensation system, the smoking right should not be allowed.	0
1001910	I had a good time in the seoul university in 2009.	0
1001911	I think physical punishment makes the students study and listen to thier teachers.	0
1001912	Then the possibility of car accidents gets higher.	0
1001913	And we play the same sports game too.	0
1001914	in middle, and high school, students have expirience of radical growing of mental part, and sometimes theire physical abilitiy or power is bigger than their teacher.	0
1001915	but she teaches ethics easily to student.	0
1001916	I taught her English two or three times a week and it was both fun and helpful to me.	0
1001917	This experience made me take firm opinion that public places should protect the rights of non smokers' health.	0
1001918	They ignore their teachers, even hit.	0
1001919	Todays, i know it is banned to use celluar phones while driving.	0
1001920	Then we returned to hotel.	0
1001921	Actually, it has less advantage than using real name has.	0
1001922	Anyway, the fundamental purpose of education is taking children to right way.	0
1001923	I had a trip with my family in the vacation.	0
1001924	So their parents think their son is really changed, and feel gratitude to their son.	0
1001925	After we graduated the high school, often she and us are meet in the outside.	0
1001926	Other example is fishing.	0
1001927	I think smoking should be banned in all public buildings.	0
1001928	So we have to make laws which force using of real name on the Internet for the freedom of using clean Internet, not beause of freedom of Internet criminals.	0
1001929	I miss them so i want see them.	0
1001930	And this days, his body get sick.	0
1001931	There was so much time in this past vacation because I finally got in to the YONSEI university.	0
1001932	And at every moment a teacher do an unfair behavior, students' mind will be harmed.	0
1001933	If all Korean men be not forced to complete military service our country sometimes would dangerous.	0
1001934	Thus, I do not agree with the physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1001935	that electronic waves sometimes make cars broken out.	0
1001936	once upon a time, our parents play with frogs.	0
1001937	Whenever I asked him to borrow someting, he rent me.	0
1001938	so every normal men has to go to the army.	0
1001939	Animals should not be used in medical experiments.	0
1001940	I disagree that people must use their real name on the internet.	0
1001941	At last, I want to know how Japanese think about historical problems between Japan and Korea.	0
1001942	Thanks to these equipments that have speakers and microphones hung on the drivers ears, traffic accident rate are declining.	0
1001943	In conclusion, I firmly believe that physical punishment must be stopped in all scools because first, students are also humans like teachers, who wants to be treated more gently, and second, there is a variety of better ways to punish students.	0
1001944	However, making smoking room, and the maintanance of the room might cost a lot of money, and require some space in the building.	0
1001945	But I think the police in cyber space can prevent those event.	0
1001946	Third, physical punishment is too cruel.	0
1001947	I saw a news about high school problem.	0
1001948	They can use nickname, and they can talk to other virtual friends more brightly, and happily.	0
1001949	They didn't even wanted to get closer to me at first, but as time goes by and we got freindly with my 'ice cream' trick.	0
1001950	Few years ago, many people thought that it is the doing of young children and it would vanish sometimes.	0
1001951	In conclusion, I have shown that smoking should be prohibited in all public buildings.	0
1001952	the animals are through their acts.	0
1001953	That's why I want to try native foods of Italy like pizza and compare them with Korea's version.	0
1001954	It's not different from crime.	0
1001955	the rat who is using in those experiments just felt stressful and will die early in result.	0
1001956	This means we are exposed to same risks while driving if we don't use cell phones.	0
1001957	This is so irony.	0
1001958	I fell the exam in 2010.	0
1001959	However, I think it`s right for men to go Army to save our country.	0
1001960	Canada is ideal place for those two reasons.	0
1001961	If we can not use animals in medical experiments, we can not develp our medical technology.	0
1001962	i agree all men be forced to complete military service becouse if not exsist military and we are aimed north korea so i agree all men forced to complete military service	0
1001963	The Hae-un-dae was great.	0
1001964	Before sale, all medicine need to test.	0
1001965	He was My class teacher, He teaches me about literature by one to one, He give me a homework like literature book reading, solving non-literature questions.	0
1001966	Goverment has to clear at that point, because that negative point make people not participate military.	0
1001967	However, according to statistics of traffic many drivers that used chelluar phones during driving greatly decresed rate that was concentrating of driving.	0
1001968	So I can hardly spend morning time.	0
1001969	And it is until now on.	0
1001970	If this wasn't, I don't think that she became my girlfreind.	0
1001971	I think that they should lead them by conversation.	0
1001972	I believe it's not necessary for all Korean men to be compelled to finish military service for the following two reasons.	0
1001973	Beside uncovering real names in the internet might help to handle some rudeness and make people more polite, it will give huge source of crime to some geeks.	0
1001974	Of course, some people might talk about the so-called 'Handsfree' which lets you take a phone call without using a hand of yours.	0
1001975	I planned my Saturday in the morning, and studied all day except meal time.	0
1001976	I think it is better use real name in the internet rather than something like ID. because internet can pollute by many people who knows other people in internet don't know them.	0
1001977	Recently, I saw many people talking on cellular phones while driving.	0
1001978	Although teacher orders children don't smoking, they don't listen.	0
1001979	Also Korea men go back to university, there are may be become stupid.	0
1001980	Now I thanked her a lot because reading my diary helps me to remind my high school years.	0
1001981	I have loved more my friends since that season.	0
1001982	Physical punishment is just way to delete student-teacher conflict.	0
1001983	I think education is comprehencing students about life.	0
1001984	The police can chase crimers' real name on the Internet, so that they can arrest or fine those people.	0
1001985	First, they are 'public' buildings.	0
1001986	Some people could laugh at describing our family to pizza.	0
1001987	At first, when smoking in public place, the right of non-smoker is devastated.	0
1001988	We have to decide something through phones.	0
1001989	Today, in medical experiments, people use animals like mouses for many purposes, like studying diseases and new medicines.	0
1001990	teacher make me so afraid of doing math.	0
1001991	So the level of strength of physical punishment cannot be too high as opponents exclaim.	0
1001992	Smokers are unhappy to see that their 'smoking ground' is becoming smaller and smaller.	0
1001993	But my high school seniors said, "We can study, because my teachers make me awake.	0
1001994	For example, Israel people, whose country has a forced military service, have positioned in important position in United States.	0
1001995	I think, most interseting thing that happened to me this past vacation is to study in high school 3th year.	0
1001996	Somedays, l will gift for her on my way.	0
1001997	Surely there is no reason to teach our students by hitting.	0
1001998	The most important thing I suggested is the consideration of every person.	0
1001999	And in my experience, physical punishment would be the certain way to stop the bad action.	0
1002000	First, he is very handsome.	0
1002001	fot example, as one person smoke, the person emit smog.	0
1002002	If not, teachers and students can't trust each ohers.	0
1002003	But the smoking in public place can harm not only other's happiness but also their health.	0
1002004	She told me a lot of her experience about her life.	0
1002005	So Korean military force will be weak.	0
1002006	Effective healing can be made when the medicals develope accurately based on animals medical experiments.	0
1002007	It is very dangerous situation.	0
1002008	We are in a same class for three years in middle school but we went to different high schools.	0
1002009	Fristly, as I said smoking is harmful to people's health.	0
1002010	thesedays, physical punishment isn't allowed in many school because physical punishment break student's right.	0
1002011	The most important thing is that teachers should treat students in a justifiable and logic way.	0
1002012	So we have authority to use animals.	0
1002013	Researchers in the area must search for other methods to test their ideas rather than conducting it to the innocent animals.	0
1002014	Bad children become worse when they received physical punishments.	0
1002015	My favorite teacher in high school is my English teacher when I am 2nd grade of high school.	0
1002016	At 7 P.M., I go to church in my town.	0
1002017	We can't insist the freedom when it injure other peole.	0
1002018	However, this can be corrected by deciding the punishment by students themselves.	0
1002019	Not just humans.	0
1002020	So, I like she.	0
1002021	Punishing is a very useful method of controlling students.	0
1002022	Sometimes, I watch movie with my friends.	0
1002023	I like to play soccer and watch the soccer game on television, so if I go to United Kingdom, I'll see the soccer game of them.	0
1002024	So there is no reason for smoking, but people addict in drug name smoking.	0
1002025	Through animal experiments we can figure out what is good and bad with medicines.	0
1002026	My favorite teacher was Hong Wan Ki, the english teacher.	0
1002027	Fisrt, Japan is very close to Korea.	0
1002028	This past vacation, I played ski with friends several times.	0
1002029	He is natural to me.	0
1002030	Also, it has to be pursued on the right situations.	0
1002031	When teacher want to teach them, they don't listen to that.	0
1002032	Not using their real names gives them some feeling of protection which is essencial to providing honest opinions.	0
1002033	My parent talk to me always do not use cellular phones like a unsafe situation.	0
1002034	Recently, there was an unfortunate accidents in Yonpyeong island.	0
1002035	In the evening I usally have a time with my family.	0
1002036	Diary I wrote when I was a senior high school student has the most special meanig for me.	0
1002037	Usually people think math is difficult and I thought too.	0
1002038	So animal experiments could be helpful for themselves.	0
1002039	Person that don't smoke recieve pain in the smoke that some people smoke.	0
1002040	To solve this problem fundamentally, What's important is focusing on the unification of South and North of Korea, not on the arguement whether we should complete military service.	0
1002041	The experiments can be successful from taking a lot of mistakes.	0
1002042	because secondhand smoking is very harmful.	0
1002043	animals are different to human.	0
1002044	so many oher countries try to developing their medical technology.	0
1002045	When i was thirteen, my mom talked with friends in driving.	0
1002046	Some indiviuals may argue that the punishment is not good and should be avoided.	0
1002047	One is that nowadays technology has been improved a lot that we have tools, such as earphones, that we do not have to use our hands to have a call.	0
1002048	In other words, they are less likely to hurt somebody on the net if their real name is exposed.	0
1002049	But, the smoking should be banned at least in the public buildings.	0
1002050	I met some other best friends while playing basketball and when I want to play, they come out to play basketball with me.	0
1002051	So they are very quite and listen carefully without physical punishment.	0
1002052	Although It is difficult that all people don't smoke in public buildings ll people don't smoke in public buildings.	0
1002053	People will feel that their remarks are being watched on by other people than before and eventually, the diversity of opinion will be decreased inevitably.	0
1002054	She always gave me a hand even if when she was also busy to study her own.	0
1002055	Smoking is so bad.	0
1002056	The students listen to their teacher's talk and order well for not to be punished, but they do not honor teachers, do not thank to teachers; they don't follow teachers in real mind.	0
1002057	So when parents, teacher, or someone who have duty for children going to give physical punishment to the children, they should remember the reason of that punishment to the child is that he/she loves that child so much that they cannot just watch the regretful mistakes are made by our valuable children.	0
1002058	And when time elapsed, fewer people died.	0
1002059	I believe that is way to treat other and another sick.	0
1002060	so student will be fight to physical punishment and fanally that's effect will be zero.	0
1002061	And I think to be a good role model, showing physical punishment to students is not a good way.	0
1002062	If the law makes people to use real name, the problem would get more serious.	0
1002063	Cigarettes pollute the air in rooms and this makes people unpleasurable.	0
1002064	Fourth, my best friend has great appreance and great ability.	0
1002065	The smell can make sensitive person vomit and some people feel dizzyness.	0
1002066	In opposite situation, in other words, little physical punishment exist in schools, student can't be willing to mock and speak rude words to any teachers because they are afraid of physical punishment.	0
1002067	Physical punishment is not also the perpect way to make the students be real student, but it have some effect somebody who is affraid physical punishment.	0
1002068	Thesedays, I have a lot of free time.	0
1002069	Some people insist that physical punishment is mentally harmful for students.	0
1002070	Car accidents is not only a simple accident usaully.	0
1002071	So, student understand that physical punishment is the education.	0
1002072	The very really important thing is that "Driver's concentration on driving".	0
1002073	If we use real name online, I think it is easier to prevent money from being stolen in any way and to find the criminals after crime has happened than not using real name.	0
1002074	As I said before, the topic is now very controversial.	0
1002075	Morever, I think experiment helps studying the theory that we can't understand.	0
1002076	Look at what we are confronting, DPRK?	0
1002077	There are babies, chilren, and pragnant.	0
1002078	Using the real names on the Internet does not solve problems that Internet have.	0
1002079	An opinion can get power only when the speaker's name is certain.	0
1002080	Thus, my usual life on Saturadays is with my friends or my mother.	0
1002081	There are a lot of researches about car drivers who make a phone call while driving.	0
1002082	Some people say mental punishment is better than physical punishment.	0
1002083	After visting grandpa's cemetary I played games with my relatives.	0
1002084	etc those will be decreased when the vicious practice are banded.	0
1002085	In reallity, there are lots of accident cases which is taken because of using cellular phone and the accident can break your bones, organs, and even kill you.	0
1002086	Also, riding horse was the first time in my life, too.	0
1002087	Am High School. he is kind.	0
1002088	Also there are some people who believe that hands-free equipment is okay to use while driving.	0
1002089	So I recommend that researchers must develop computer program for experiments or use the animals in experiment which feel pain less.	0
1002090	It was the best.	0
1002091	So I know what his mind about someone or something, and maybe his and my concerning other things could be equal.	0
1002092	They enjoy lots of celebration ceremony including 'Bull Fighting.	0
1002093	Many people worry that using a cellular phone disturbes people's safe driving and lead to serious accidents.	0
1002094	Second, relationship between student and teacher is declined.	0
1002095	Moreover, If we go to complete military service, we must obey the rule of military and wear the uniform.	0
1002096	There were assignments for each team, so whi	0
1002097	So I can get a good grades on the test.	0
1002098	So organizing school rules to same means organizing their future to same.	0
1002099	Students have to know that this is serious thing and should be changed.	0
1002100	So we can make better than we talk with seeing other's face.	0
1002101	A research has confirmed this.	0
1002102	Next, physical punishment is more effective ways to make students good than non-physical punishment.	0
1002103	For these reasons, animal should not be used in medical testing.	0
1002104	Driving is very hard work, so drivers must concentrate when they driving.	0
1002105	For example, frogs and mouse are sometimes used in school.	0
1002106	Mr.	0
1002107	And drivers who used cell phong while driving should be punished.	0
1002108	But Human must to have an resposibility for protecting animals.	0
1002109	And then we go to the pc room and I play a lot of games with my team members.	0
1002110	He thought that our minds are the primary things have to consider in every moments, and did like what he did.	0
1002111	To use real name can be harm to perform that duty.	0
1002112	Though his advice, I sometime can escape from the problem that I have.	0
1002113	Altough because of many reasons I`m not going to major in math, I would like to study mathmatics more detaily.	0
1002114	Educators have to give students a chance to explain their behavior.	0
1002115	I still tremble at the imagination of how many lives I could have risked that day.	0
1002116	Also, when one student receive physical punishment, he or she will recognize its damage and try hard not to make a same mistake.	0
1002117	So it's just so natural to kill animals for eating.	0
1002118	So, if a driver uses cell phone while driving, it would means that they don't concentrate on their driving.	0
1002119	Second, I was interested in historical connection between Korea and Japan.	0
1002120	so, students know more about their faults and can regret their acting.	0
1002121	For educating, teachers need a power that can controll the student's behavior that can hurt other people.	0
1002122	when who spoke how harm about smoking that is why we stop the smoking then i'll agree with him.	0
1002123	First of all, Childhood is a period when a person's temper and personality are formed.	0
1002124	Second reason is that in Japan there are lots of monuments affected by Backjea.	0
1002125	To sum up, I think physical punishment should not be allowed in all schools since its impact is only transient and it even affects to children's personality.	0
1002126	So many Korean men argue that it's nor fair comparing to women who aren't forced to complete military service.	0
1002127	It's very interesting to me.	0
1002128	For instance, I bought a puppy last month and insulted some liquid drugs that can prevent it from being infected.	0
1002129	We were very excited because we could feel like a bird.	0
1002130	Not concentrating in driving causes not to watch obstacles or pedestrian, etc.	0
1002131	In this situation, If we abolish physical punishment, this situation will be more serious.	0
1002132	And if one student is very rude or loud, she or he influences the class.	0
1002133	So, we can clear the animal's pain problem by paying some more money for medical experiments and we can let others know the reason why we should use some animals.	0
1002134	whenever I didn't, he hit me really strong.	0
1002135	Cellurar phones sould not be allowed while driving.	0
1002136	they will develpe our natural science.	0
1002137	Since it is undoubtful that we have to do experiments, I think we have no choice but to use animals in medical experiments for the following three reasons.	0
1002138	It was really effective to remind us our misbehaviors and our class started to act differently.	0
1002139	Actually this rule is on the desk whether abandon or not.	0
1002140	His punishment was not emotionally broken out.	0
1002141	These problems is a kind of steps we should go through for non-physical punishment education.	0
1002142	It was clear solution that will be solve many problems.	0
1002143	They are crawling and dying in a place like jail, even now.	0
1002144	In my opinion, its color changed because of smoke.	0
1002145	If we can't use animals, we have to test our medicines or chemicals by using volunteers, but it is really dangerous, and costs really high.	0
1002146	For example, Real Madrid and FC Barcelona have very interesting children football class.	0
1002147	"But I really remember that times forever.	0
1002148	That means smoking is bad for not only the one who smokes, but also the second hand smokers who have no guilty except being aroung the smokers.	0
1002149	Third, It is national waste that all Korean men go to military.	0
1002150	First of all if one is smoking, the smoke from the cigarette disfuses to all area and affects other people.	0
1002151	Thus, for our freedom and privacy, we must use good words and do good manner on the Internet.	0
1002152	Frist of all, we should mind not to use it on driving.	0
1002153	Country gives them other way.	0
1002154	That helps us invent new vaccine.	0
1002155	He jogged with me and my classmates 3 times a week.	0
1002156	Maybe I just wanna fly, wanna live don't want to die.	0
1002157	If people use real name on the internet, people refrain such activities than now.	0
1002158	if doesn't, the result is bad.	0
1002159	Truly, the world is more peaceful than the past.	0
1002160	So in my opinion, it is more effective to teach people how to act on the Internet and do not make other people irrtating.	0
1002161	If occured, who will take the responsibility for the problem?	0
1002162	What South Korea needs to do is letting people do whatever they want to do and should be economically developed with increased workforce.	0
1002163	Therefore, again, I disagree with the policy of completing forced military service.	0
1002164	It's not solution.	0
1002165	On the other hand, i sometimes disagree with the physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1002166	Under teachers reasonal decision and when there is the student who really makes the 'Tension' mess the physical punishment is agreed and essential.	0
1002167	Aditionally, I watch American Dramas on Saturday.	0
1002168	I think animals should be used properly in medical experiments.	0
1002169	Likewise, some Korean men those can't complete military service normally should be given another possible work for Military Diffense.	0
1002170	I agree with the physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1002171	Before i graduate highschool, i was usually spent my saturday playing soccer with my friends.	0
1002172	We, people should know about it.	0
1002173	The student got a kick on his head from his homeroom teacher for being late to the class, and fell in to coma.	0
1002174	So, I wish to visit Turkey soon.	0
1002175	What I like about my best friend is that he is always next to me.	0
1002176	In addition, when biology class, teacher suggested to us experince that watch inside a fish and we did it.	0
1002177	We eat animals and we use animals in making clothes.	0
1002178	I absolutely agree with this statement.	0
1002179	We need some other rule for this, about parents.	0
1002180	And that made me get better grade at test and more intersted in Physics.	0
1002181	But I have solutions to decrease smoking Many people often smoke in public buildings.	0
1002182	They must keep in their car line, adjust accelerater, brake, gears and so forth.	0
1002183	So l listen many thing about school.	0
1002184	Many politicians argued that they will make physical punishment illegal in shools, and actually some provinces are implementing the laws which banish physical punishment in school.	0
1002185	In that situation, it is difficult to solve the conflict by communication.	0
1002186	Whenever i see this doll, i think my kind grandfather.	0
1002187	I think the Korea is more generous to drivers than any other countries.	0
1002188	What I mean is that I want to feel their improved culture.	0
1002189	It's my opinion.	0
1002190	According to their religions, they are not allowed to do military service.	0
1002191	In this situation, If we don't prepare their attack, we will lose to them and all of our precious asset we have produced until now will be lost.	0
1002192	This way cars would not rush and make less chance of accidents.	0
1002193	He also talked his days when he was studied at Japan, and talked about his Japanese friend.	0
1002194	Madrid is the capital of Spain.	0
1002195	We kill them to save ourselves.	0
1002196	This is paradox.	0
1002197	D course are in their golden age of their career.	0
1002198	For example, it is a common sense not to smoke in hospitals or in kindergartens.	0
1002199	and when it over, i couldn't think something another although going to seongsan ilchulbong's highest land was very hard, i think that is not no use.	0
1002200	So the work that is related to information can be done by women.	0
1002201	So someone must control them to right way.	0
1002202	But if they can be danger to human, it must be checked by animal experiments in advance.	0
1002203	I was very proud of myself when we had an math exam.	0
1002204	I think we can allowed to have enough time to spend to do work in car.	0
1002205	They have some potential that they will be social offender.	0
1002206	I was very happy and I had it almost everywhere in my pocket.	0
1002207	Many people said it is not dangerous when we use ear phone calling.	0
1002208	Because it violate other's previlage.	0
1002209	If I have a chance to go abroad, I hope to travel Finland.	0
1002210	As I think these reasons, I think that physical punishment must be allowed in all schools.	0
1002211	So they don't think result of their action, words.	0
1002212	I met him 6 years ago and I dated him for 5 years.	0
1002213	So I apply the mechanical route, I dream my future of Mechanic engineer.	0
1002214	Earlier, like on Thursday or Friday, I call some of my friends and ask if they're free on this Saturday.	0
1002215	In this way, we can protect people from secondhand smoking and also let other people smoke.	0
1002216	My favorite teacher in high school was my homeroom teacher when I was in 3th grade.	0
1002217	doing things while driving diperses driver's concentration and also it makes drivers act slowly in emergency situations.	0
1002218	We went there because I have an older sister who is studying in the Unisted States and we wanted to meet her.	0
1002219	I want to learn math deeply in my unversity.	0
1002220	Also students are young person.	0
1002221	After talk with her, I could concentrate to French mojor.	0
1002222	but i'm handsome too.	0
1002223	Handle of automobiles need two hands.	0
1002224	Both students and teachers.	0
1002225	Safety guidelines could include 'no painful treatments to animals', 'operations should be authorized by the government', 'surgeries should be operated with proper anexthetics', 'providing comfortable living environment while they are alive' and 'giving them a way of well-dying', etc.	0
1002226	From then, I started to read many chemistry books to know more about chemistry world.	0
1002227	Even some students started to ignored teachers.	0
1002228	So my last answer is a ward.	0
1002229	Also, if smoking is banned in all public buildings, smokers will be able to get a new chance to quit smoking and live healthy lives.	0
1002230	For example, they can work social welfare center, city hall.	0
1002231	So we can simulate the experiments in computer.	0
1002232	Other students don't talk friend or family.	0
1002233	If you have ever drived even for once, you will surely get to know that driving is far more delicate thing than you can see.	0
1002234	It is a same thing to smoking.	0
1002235	After I eat something, I prepare to go out if I have some appointment with my friends.	0
1002236	It is really dangerous.	0
1002237	In that situation, the babaies can be the undeveloped babies.	0
1002238	And Hong-kong is a lot of funniest looks.	0
1002239	To control and instruct children, the fear and respect of teachers are used.	0
1002240	As I said before, Physical punishment in schools can bring negative effects to both schools and students.	0
1002241	Secondly, the usage of animals in the medical experiments will reduce the experiment budget.	0
1002242	First, Forcing people to use their real name can harm citizens' freedom of expressing thier own opinions.	0
1002243	My favorite subject is Math for following two reasons.	0
1002244	However that is when teacher use physical punishment for his eager, his satisfaction.	0
1002245	But surely most interesting thing was riding a board in mountain.	0
1002246	There are big amusement parks such as Disneyland, so I can have a lot of fun there.	0
1002247	However, smoking in public building will hurt not only the smoker but also other people in the building.	0
1002248	Smoking depends on each person's favor, so as smokers choose to smoke, non smokers can choose not to.	0
1002249	if he have a difficulty to control his automobiles, unpridictted things would happen to him, and he is hurted by a accident.	0
1002250	It was so memorable	0
1002251	We spent there 3 nights and 4 days.	0
1002252	It was a bad experience.	0
1002253	History prooves humans are intelligent animals, too.	0
1002254	Other students see their friend's punishment and then they think that I never do that because it is not good action as well as they have physical punishment.	0
1002255	One reason is that banning smoke in building is stream of many developed nations.	0
1002256	I was too.	0
1002257	I think this is very interesting.	0
1002258	Since My mother and father had to work at company, My grandmother nourished me until I go to elementary school.	0
1002259	For example, I read book about calculus.	0
1002260	and without love for student, physical punishment of children in schools is not punishment.	0
1002261	Second, she was very wonderful Korean teacher.	0
1002262	There are many reasons of this oppinion.	0
1002263	He is my best friend.	0
1002264	Therefore I don't agree with usning animals in medical experiments.	0
1002265	Every Sunday we take out of this plate and my whole family eat lunch together.	0
1002266	In this winter vacation, we watched the video again.	0
1002267	Non smokers even have no fealters, so they intake harmful ingrediance more.	0
1002268	Maybe I have to deal with some difficult problems in my real life, but thanks to mathematics, I could solve it.	0
1002269	So physical punishment is needed to manage the students effectively.	0
1002270	I am learning how to drive in driver license acardemy these days.	0
1002271	May be that experience feel like go new world.	0
1002272	Sometimes I envy him whose attitude is very activity.	0
1002273	I don't like him in some reason.	0
1002274	He is a good player at soccer and star player at basketball.	0
1002275	Biology gives us how we can be healthy without any disease.	0
1002276	Thesedays, many people do bad things on Internet like hacking using the character that people don't know who they are.	0
1002277	If you use cellular phone, you cannont concentrate on driving.	0
1002278	Their are more than 10 million internet users in Korea.	0
1002279	Because if people use their ID, not their real name, most of the people don't have their responsibility for Internet users and they attack other's opinion.	0
1002280	I always played basketball in P.E class.	0
1002281	So my friend imediately go to the woman, and he lifted her on his back.	0
1002282	In modern society, automobiles and cellular phones are the most popular blessings.	0
1002283	Please consider animals and people same living things- that can be the way both people and animals live on the Earth happily.	0
1002284	And If the law is already existed, the government have to strengthen the law.	0
1002285	Many students are still doing that thing.	0
1002286	Shortly, I think all Korean men should be forced to complete military service now.	0
1002287	I thought it is boring.	0
1002288	For instance, in prospect of financial power, South Korea have ten times more powerful than North Korea.	0
1002289	Considering merits of the Internet, there are online game, Internet lecture, useful information, problem solution discussion.	0
1002290	When they are using cell phones while driving, they have to think about two things, not only one.	0
1002291	I heard that using microphone do not have an effect of protecting the accident.	0
1002292	If there is not any companion or they ought to talk on the cellular phone directly, they can stop their cars at near places.	0
1002293	Therefore, using a real name could be the solution about naughty comments and other social problems which belong to 'non-real-name'.	0
1002294	They realize their real life and their activity was very careful.	0
1002295	They address they are the most superior people in the world.	0
1002296	I could understand her but I was angry with her.	0
1002297	So what I want to say is 'do tell' the student what they did wrong or what they should do, not in the way when we raise pigs.	0
1002298	But all the teacher can do is just yell at them.	0
1002299	If people use their real name, the time that takes to track and catch crimes would be shorter than unusing real name.	0
1002300	the physical punishment needs in schools but It should be final thing to punish.	0
1002301	but because of this phenemenon, a lot of school students are not respect their teacher and they think they stand above thier teacher's head.	0
1002302	In fact, when children being punished, they think 'I won't do this.'.	0
1002303	Childrens' human rights should not be threated by teachers in schools.	0
1002304	Because Our famliy have only one family picture it has special meaning.	0
1002305	He always said "try it!	0
1002306	There is two options to select a subject.	0
1002307	But it sould be based on the scientist's respect to animals.	0
1002308	There is some reasons why I like math.	0
1002309	The result was decised.	0
1002310	No, smoking doesn't have to be banned in all public building.	0
1002311	her name is 'Seon Hee Lee'.	0
1002312	It was when schools were considered as a place to nuture young soldiers; especially when Japanese army took control of Korean reign and took advantage of the country.	0
1002313	Moreover, people can gain useful materials from animals.	0
1002314	Because students are not complet.	0
1002315	I want to go one of the english speaking countries because I can only speak english other than korea.	0
1002316	And then there is no need to give a punishment to students.	0
1002317	but you might think that it can not be problem.	0
1002318	Because for conversation with children teacher must know children.	0
1002319	second, my best friend have leadership.	0
1002320	Guess what happened.	0
1002321	They say if using nickname or ID is abandoned and citizens have to use real name, then opinions about important social issues may be shrinked, which affect negatively on social media.	0
1002322	First of all, allowing the physical punishment give a right to listen the lesson, In the school, there are some students who is hard to control raise problems.	0
1002323	This trend is not broken out in 1980s.	0
1002324	I want to visit USA.	0
1002325	And when I feel sad or discouraged, she always listen my story and understand me.	0
1002326	Also, Physical punishment cannot bring any good educational effects.	0
1002327	And they also assert through these experiments human society can develop.	0
1002328	The driver of that car usually hang on the phone while driving.	0
1002329	I have a many friends.	0
1002330	So, government must restrict their freedom.	0
1002331	If it's my situation, I fight with selector.	0
1002332	This right is same human's right.	0
1002333	But I took his advise, and my math score became very good.	0
1002334	Put more strongly, a democratic society can have hard time managing due to lack of diversity which is the essence of democracy.	0
1002335	This would not happen if smokers could smoke in buildings, especially in smoking rooms.	0
1002336	In the middle school and high school especially students become emotional not rational, also feel their parents and teachers interupt their thinking and behavior.	0
1002337	So we don't have to think about this topic seriously.	0
1002338	In high school grade 1 and 2, my physics score is very poor but third grade, I met a nice teacher and like physics.	0
1002339	Child is more dangerous when inhaling the smoke of cigarette.	0
1002340	Also if they are punished physically, they know they were wrong, but they never can know which of what they did are wrong, and nothing can be changed in their mind.	0
1002341	Next, there are alternative punishments like push-ups or running a few laps around a playground.	0
1002342	So It was profitable to us.	0
1002343	And at night I read books in bed.	0
1002344	Reversely, I can give a word to my friend when he need my help.	0
1002345	He was really sorry and said now he would never use a cellular phone.	0
1002346	Cigar certaintly is a product that harms our health, but since it is addictive smokers can not easily quit smoking.	0
1002347	family house has many ability.	0
1002348	As a result, i learned biology 1, 2 and my biology teacher became my favorite teacher.	0
1002349	and it can injure children in physical and mantal.	0
1002350	I'm planning to learn Spainish in recent future, so going on a trip to Spain would be good for me not only to inspire my passion to learn it, but also to understand it.	0
1002351	physical punishment is not just punishment.	0
1002352	But I am very stressd out.	0
1002353	one is that physical punishment makes kids obey to teachers effectively and whe teachers use physical punishment smartly, It can enhance children's health condition.	0
1002354	our technology of biology is very developed so I do not have a doubt if we work hard we can find the alternatives in the near future.	0
1002355	Non-smokers don't want to be with somkers.	0
1002356	they think their teacher very easy.	0
1002357	In my opinion, this is very good and essential law.	0
1002358	So the government must realize the serious situations and should find out solutions.	0
1002359	Real name is not the problem to bad netizens to do bad things, and if we use real name on the Internet, some netizens who do not do bad things will get damages, because real name is also the privacy of people.	0
1002360	I can say to legisters not to go to easy thinking.	0
1002361	I strongly beileve that the above argument is untrue because of these things: physical penalty could hurt students and there could be another alternatives.	0
1002362	For example, In China's case, China government is restricting china netizen's expression.	0
1002363	Because I have been grow with books.	0
1002364	Nevertheless, even if preventing using cell phones while driving is a violation of one's right, it should be prohibited for two reasons.	0
1002365	As we see, there is almost nothing good that let smokers smoke in all the public place.	0
1002366	Then What shall we do?	0
1002367	And even nowadays, though the law is banning smokers not to smoke in most of the public places, we can easily see the man smoking in anywhere.	0
1002368	Many good people are offended by the people who are always speak negatively.	0
1002369	If a little problem - which is now finited to public buildings - solved, there would be a chaos effect.	0
1002370	Therefore I agree with the physical punishment of chilidren.	0
1002371	That belief enables our friendship to last forever.	0
1002372	We uses animals in medical experiments not because they don't have their own right so we can use them in any ways but because we don't know another way to replace animal uses.	0
1002373	Animals used in medical experiments is sensitive opinion.	0
1002374	He is also funny that he always make a lot of fun in our group of friends.	0
1002375	If smoking makes many people unconfortable, I think it's right that it should be banned.	0
1002376	We sometimes hear the News about Death of famous top star.	0
1002377	I'm not a good singer, but it's okay.	0
1002378	It is often believed that car drivers may use cell phone while driving.	0
1002379	He was very passional teacher to student , especially me, because I was good student.	0
1002380	Maybee, many people are sorry for asking mothers to buy some clothes.	0
1002381	It is very funny activity.	0
1002382	Smoking people and non-smoking people more think about wich other than now all people will haven't unconvinent time.	0
1002383	Dong high school.	0
1002384	The photo is printed on the plate.	0
1002385	If teachers use the physical punishment over and over again just to control the children directly and instantly, they will get used to it.	0
1002386	Even there was signed No smoking in here.	0
1002387	According to study math more, my math score went to soar.	0
1002388	there are no people who wants to be used in experiments.	0
1002389	But you think protecting animals and there rights is more important than making new vaccines and healing patients?	0
1002390	So using the real name on Internet cannot help this situation.	0
1002391	But this problem can be fixed by teaching people to have responsibility about their behavior on the Internet.	0
1002392	Most of all, it is already known that smoke is very harmful not only the smoker, but also non-smokers, people around smoker.	0
1002393	Though it is not that important in talking with foreigners, I like the grammar part most.	0
1002394	Compared to livestocks raised for their own meat, those in medical experiments are not so different as they are breed, grown and sometimes killed for humen.	0
1002395	It takes a lot of life from so many living things.	0
1002396	From now on, I will recognize to my neighbor to take care of their body.	0
1002397	However, my Saturdays are quit special.	0
1002398	Even though it is beneficial for human to carry out the animal testing, it is definitely harmful to animals.	0
1002399	and they feel friendly each other because most of them want to be soldier.	0
1002400	It's gained by pusing and forcing environment.	0
1002401	Through punishments, students become a mature men and live as a part of Korean Society	0
1002402	So I had hope that I can do it.	0
1002403	Airs Rock is big rock that changes color whenever the time goes.	0
1002404	He was condemned by anonymous internet users.	0
1002405	Due to it's closeness to north pole and many high mountains, lots of place is covered by snow.	0
1002406	I also think that it is unhumane to force every man to get in military.	0
1002407	If nobody in high schools, that do the physical punishment for children, high schools going to very confused.	0
1002408	Therefore, there is no reason the punish the students.	0
1002409	When I study and finally know this, it makes me really happy.	0
1002410	He always had accurate answer I wanted to know and told me more thing about my questions.	0
1002411	He always contended that speaking is more important.	0
1002412	But I dont' obey their right to smoke.	0
1002413	Therefore I'm for the idea that drivers of automobiles should not be allowed to use celluar phones while driveing.	0
1002414	I'm studing coffee with my friend.	0
1002415	He was my homeroom teacher.	0
1002416	Our country sells the cigarette.	0
1002417	We could have been more developed than today's if we haven't forced Korean men.	0
1002418	but If you chose all of them and try to catch them you couldn't catch even one of them.	0
1002419	The human cannot be used in dangerous medical experiments.	0
1002420	Experiments need a target.	0
1002421	When a cigarette was thrown into the trash basket, it can burn all the trash and become a big fire.	0
1002422	Since they believe doing some criminal action without their name is not a big deal, the crimes are becoming more violent and affecting the real lives.	0
1002423	So I want to study Spanish and go to see the greatest soccer club in the world.	0
1002424	Usually women don't like smoke.	0
1002425	so I agree to use animals in medical experiments.	0
1002426	Since people can hide their real name in the Internet, they write bad words to each other.	0
1002427	Since I don't live near the sea, I have no chance to eat those things.	0
1002428	I have a best friend whose name is Sue Jeong.	0
1002429	almost everyone who are not smoke do not like the smell of smoking that smokers make.	0
1002430	So I think that we have to make a room for smokers in public buildings and Smoking allowed only that room.	0
1002431	And the more important thing is that our nation, korea, has the bomb.	0
1002432	But I think many children don't know what they are doing and why that is wrong.	0
1002433	And it can do whatever I can't do on real world.	0
1002434	I'm assure that some highly skilled drivers can do the two things at the same time, but no matter how, we should avoid car accident by not using cellular phones while driving.	0
1002435	However physical punishment doesn't give a student time to think about his or her own fault.	0
1002436	seperate drive a car and use celluar phone is disrupt modern people's life.	0
1002437	But English is the other thing to Korean. so it is really interesting to learn new thing.	0
1002438	Communicative teacher is the best.	0
1002439	I agree with the physical punishment.	0
1002440	these children will be grown up and society also will be reshaped by them.	0
1002441	And smoking could be blown far away, so it can harm a lot of people.	0
1002442	That's all.	0
1002443	I went on a short trip with my relatives and family to Paju this past vacation.	0
1002444	I know that there are many people who disagree with me and argue that there's a right of smoking.	0
1002445	When children see the people in the smoking room, children have curiousity to smoking.	0
1002446	And what remains in fields of education?	0
1002447	I don't think it's a good alternation about physical pusimnet.	0
1002448	Because, I think, smoking's smell is very, very bad.	0
1002449	Sure sure!!	0
1002450	However, because of one moment that he can't concentrate on driving, he missed the traffic signal and got in a car crash.	0
1002451	This is my usual satuday.	0
1002452	I went Chunceon for MT with my high school friends.	0
1002453	First, Spain has many fascinating tourist attractions.	0
1002454	So I think it is nice idea to make 'smoking room' for smokers.	0
1002455	but my mom was angry to me.	0
1002456	Second, that car's number is 7377.	0
1002457	this phnomena is really bad thing.	0
1002458	For example, one calling should be about 3minutes with one person.	0
1002459	Using the phone is relatively small thing, but the result car accident is very critical, even death.	0
1002460	Last week i went to the Jeju island.	0
1002461	because when teacher upset, sometimes they lose their reason.	0
1002462	The second reason is about my friends.	0
1002463	This power's object is save citizen's life.	0
1002464	But accident is happen anytime and anywhere, if automobiles are runing a load.	0
1002465	I think my father and my elder sister is best reason.	0
1002466	person more love animal more think animal every animal live more easy life.	0
1002467	In a short word, I would like to say yes.	0
1002468	For example, a person calls a driver on emergency.	0
1002469	In this aspect, corporal punishment can spur students to concentrate on their studying.	0
1002470	The rule should be that physical punishment are used in the case that most people agree he or she does wrong behavior.	0
1002471	Secound, the smoke can harm other people's health, even extremely.	0
1002472	But in spite of this price, they don't stop.	0
1002473	They also know that we can't know their real name.	0
1002474	This, however, would not be happened.	0
1002475	This site is managed by millions of people using real name.	0
1002476	So I think we have to find other ways to correct behave and educate children.	0
1002477	And actually, there is no driving that is not dangerous.	0
1002478	but positive one is bigger than the other.	0
1002479	I loved her so much.	0
1002480	Thus I agree about using real name on the Internet.	0
1002481	Fourthly, when people smokes it smells a lot and it remains long.	0
1002482	They can smash or kick students legally.	0
1002483	So she teach me a awesome solution about my slump.	0
1002484	That accident happened because he used cell phone while driving.	0
1002485	Women also have pain and hard time in their life.	0
1002486	The last thing that I like is we have same taste in food.	0
1002487	Also, in music class, music teacher made comfortable atmosphere so our classmates just enjoyed the music.	0
1002488	First of all, physical punishment has negative effects to children.	0
1002489	For instance, at 1~4level, there will be a verbal punishment or indirect physical punishmnet instead of direct physical punishment.	0
1002490	And it strengthened our family's relationship.	0
1002491	Physical punishment has been a controversial issue these days since government wanted to abolish it.	0
1002492	No, I never agree with the physical punishment.	0
1002493	In other words, physical punishment makes the problem worse and worse.	0
1002494	So the photoes that have our past, happy or sad memories wonderful retrospect has the special meaning and are the best gift for our family.	0
1002495	So if I didn't meet that person, I think I couldn't be sitted here.	0
1002496	So sometimes I think he is not a friend but a mentor.	0
1002497	I traveled America to see good universities, such as Harvard university.	0
1002498	We went to the same elementary school, so it already has been 10 years.	0
1002499	The animals are not our tools and they are not the things that we can use them by all our thought.	0
1002500	I would say to them, "What are you thinking about this question?"	0
1002501	This war has not finished yet.	0
1002502	But we can't confirm this drug.	0
1002503	So we behave differently on the Internet.	0
1002504	First, even though it is hard to measure the value of a life, it is quite obvious that human life is more important than those of animals.	0
1002505	And also, there are people that really don't want to service in military for almost 2 years.	0
1002506	I go to the library.	0
1002507	But I think that at least, people should tell the right place to smoke in from the wrong place to.	0
1002508	so I like his voice and i talk to him 'you have good voice that other pople can have good memory'.	0
1002509	NO. Animals should not be used in medical experiments.	0
1002510	it will be really difficult to find out like that way but it is really nacessary, not be forced but some adventages which make people want to go when they complete military service.	0
1002511	It is the conflict between some people who value human's authority and others who value animals' authority.	0
1002512	Doing such things can have severe damage to our morality and should be limited.	0
1002513	Moreover, using real name online promotes Internet users to develop serious relationships.	0
1002514	Recently, many firms ban smoking in ther buildings.	0
1002515	That points are very exciting and i like.	0
1002516	We can talk, and we have brilliant technologies.	0
1002517	For example, when I asked my grandfather how the school was, he answered to me that he thanks to teachers even though the punishment hurt him.	0
1002518	Brazil has Amazon that is the Biggest river in all of the world.	0
1002519	He is math teacher.	0
1002520	I agree with the opinion that all Korean men should complete military service, because Korea has a very specific enemy, north Korea, which keeps threathening the peace of Korea.	0
1002521	A boy who looked like a high school student massaged my foot.	0
1002522	At the same time, you should abide to the Korea's law.	0
1002523	This measures help us to deal with not only the farm's problems but also have our medical industry developed very well.	0
1002524	And if our medical technology is improved enough to stretch all creature's life span, we don't need to use animals in medical experiments and also pay to animals about past's wrongdoing.	0
1002525	My favorite teacher in high school is my homeroom teacher Won Min-Sun.	0
1002526	It was in the bar that i have a nice feeling.	0
1002527	It explain D vector.	0
1002528	If the policy is enacted, people will give lots of attention on driving.	0
1002529	We all have real name.	0
1002530	So some case, Men who are back from military service could be isolated from underaged friends.	0
1002531	He taught us our country's best time in history.	0
1002532	Also, when I was embarassed by the situation that drunken man speaks loudly to me, he helped me.	0
1002533	Since I had bought it at sixth grade of elementary school.	0
1002534	so did i before the korean class.	0
1002535	We can read the messege after driving and give a return call with just saying that "Sorry, I was driving".	0
1002536	My best friend is very thoughtful and generous.	0
1002537	Because smoking harm both smoker and non-smoker.	0
1002538	Because that object makes me be here now.	0
1002539	As a Korean, that subject was easy to understand and was very useful.	0
1002540	I think that people must use their real name.	0
1002541	People should use their real name on the Internet.	0
1002542	It's very wonderful.	0
1002543	As we raise cattle for the purpose of eating, we also feed animals for the purpose of medicine.	0
1002544	With him we are popular.	0
1002545	and develop my study skill and enjoy reading a books.	0
1002546	Then, Suprisingly, he changed.	0
1002547	And she is helpful for everyone.	0
1002548	But there are many people who didn't, and it's quite uncomfortable to meet them for the others.	0
1002549	My friends who have been to Egypt say that they are very kind and humorous and they like korean.	0
1002550	However, I believe that we must use our real name for the following two aspects.	0
1002551	But we don't have to do this must by soldier.	0
1002552	If we don't focus driving, we can make big car accident and we can kill innocent people.	0
1002553	So Math gives me enjoyment to study.	0
1002554	Angry makes people worse.	0
1002555	If some student violent school's rule, teacher should teach their student.	0
1002556	Those pictuers remind my family members the happy moments while traveling.	0
1002557	so her nickname is fat angel.	0
1002558	This is more important matter than those problems that will be caused by unification.	0
1002559	i wanted to make him happy.	0
1002560	These are very funny to me and these make me healthy.	0
1002561	In Korea many people smoke, smoking is already become their habit, so they usally throw them everywhere, and the building will be dirty.	0
1002562	So I have a lot special memory with my grandmother than others.	0
1002563	I admit that there are some other tools like standing at back of the classroom or cleaning the classroom.	0
1002564	lastly, using real name on the Internet is good for credit.	0
1002565	But a little mistake-I heard it is using cell phone to chat with is friends-, in his point, not even mistakes for himself, had him staying all of his rest in life in bed.	0
1002566	Recently, there are many serious happenings in our society.	0
1002567	First of all, using cell phone while driving makes driver distracted from driving and makes hard to respond properly to the urgent situation happening ahead.	0
1002568	despite experiments, it could be more worth than have nothing.	0
1002569	Pain is makes the student angry.	0
1002570	Other things had not correct answer so that made me tired.	0
1002571	However after the development, they have no more power to recover their problems on their own.	0
1002572	If physical punishment is used for education properly, it can be a good method of education.	0
1002573	But I discontinued that, because of studying.	0
1002574	First of all, the Republic of South Korea is in war now.	0
1002575	For our society's future, I think physical punishment should be allowed in all schools.	0
1002576	But I did not hate military service.	0
1002577	From then, We became the best friends.	0
1002578	That's why they didn't their duty.	0
1002579	Because if a man, can hear.	0
1002580	Furthermore, Korea doesn't need so many soldiers.	0
1002581	so we like go to shopping or seeing movie.	0
1002582	Beacuse the young babies made me felt so happy than everything happened in 1year.	0
1002583	When he saw me taking subway and bus to go to the school, he suggested me go to school with him by his father's car.	0
1002584	If there is no physical punishment , the teachers have much trouble to teach the students in right direction.	0
1002585	That day, I was so happy that i told every friends and they conglatulated me.	0
1002586	My mother and I was very upset since we have to have a dinner with his smoke.	0
1002587	so they can follow what they see.	0
1002588	altought my friends and i decided to go another college and university, I think we can allways feel like staying together because while we slept, eat, make dishes together.	0
1002589	Physical punishment should not be allowed in all schools.	0
1002590	If they loss the prouds, They will difficult to adjust with others and study time at school then their exam scores will get worse than before.	0
1002591	So most of my childhood memory is related to my granma.	0
1002592	Then, we don't need to complete military service.	0
1002593	So, we try to solve our faults and mistakes.	0
1002594	Men who mised the chance to study for the future is great lose.	0
1002595	I have seen a policeman catch the driver who unconsciously used her cell phone, she not knowing there was a policeman in front of her.	0
1002596	Physical punishment shouldn't be allowed in all schools and there has no exception.	0
1002597	I don't think so.	0
1002598	My favorite teacher in high school was chemistry teacher.	0
1002599	Although he is dog, our family felt like 'He is our baby.	0
1002600	Many people from elementry school students to grandmother use Internet.	0
1002601	they make me happy.	0
1002602	my mother is high school art teacher.	0
1002603	Though I fell the science high school test, I wanted to study the chemistry more.	0
1002604	So there are no problem.	0
1002605	When standing in a bus stop, walking streets or even though in library, I can see many people smoking in such a public places.	0
1002606	I think all animals have feelings like human and they get hurt when they are used in medical experiments.	0
1002607	My family are made of 3 woman.	0
1002608	Second, If Korea started to hire armies among applicants like USA, many healthy men wouldn't join army anymore and our military force would harshly decrease.	0
1002609	If drivers use cellular phones freely, as a result, serious car accidents will be increased and traffic jam will accure.	0
1002610	I read 'Brave New World' all night that day.	0
1002611	Therefore, I think Using cellphones should not be allowed.	0
1002612	Most men are wasting their two years of valuable time at military.	0
1002613	It means that I can practice my english speaking and there is probabilty of speaking english well.	0
1002614	and you have to guarant.	0
1002615	I think that some physical punishment should be allowed in all schools.	0
1002616	They should decrease the damage or hurts that animal taken as possible.	0
1002617	It has been proven that the risk of a car accident is rapidly soar when driver is on the phone.	0
1002618	I've heard a lot that Indian is not clean but I want to experience the wildity of India.	0
1002619	Public will not listen to these kind of leaders and the society might crumbles.	0
1002620	When I was tired, One of the them used to bring some juice, cookie.	0
1002621	second, they have many special cultures which are distinct to our country.	0
1002622	In these days and also those days, in the army, the treat for new members is hostility and even people who are in high position are bullying them.	0
1002623	The reason is also the aspect of safety.	0
1002624	When they are killed by men's hands, they also lose their life and see men who are killing them with sadly and hatly eyes with tear as we haman are killed.	0
1002625	These songs are brilliant.	0
1002626	My favorite teacher in high school was my Korean teacher who take second year.	0
1002627	S.	0
1002628	that makes my mother feel sorrowful and nexy day there was some mail with box front of door.	0
1002629	They do not have to quickly call and keep on eye to police while being afraid of getting caught.	0
1002630	After lunch I have I go to music academy and play guitar.	0
1002631	Come in other people's shoes, and think about other people like a famous Korean saying.	0
1002632	Some people say that using real name will make lower chance of bad things on the net, but it is not true.	0
1002633	Some one thinks animal experiments are cruel so these should be prohibited.	0
1002634	Therefore, just punishing the children in physical way is not a only way.	0
1002635	i am happy that i can be a good friend to them.	0
1002636	However, I think the situation that Korea faces is very different from other countries' situation.	0
1002637	Cellular phones and cars are important tools to modern people.	0
1002638	More than the reason that i did it well, I enjoyed learning it because of the fact that I can use it in everyday life.	0
1002639	Therefore I think government should make a rule for the police to spend their working time to find drunken drivers, not to find drivers using cell phones.	0
1002640	Igo to fitness club to exercise and to lose some weight.	0
1002641	I thought that he is not respectable.	0
1002642	My ancestor is dead on the Korea war.	0
1002643	Using their name is same say what I am.	0
1002644	Moreover, people should make a more safe choice.	0
1002645	So she is helping my physics problem in after school.	0
1002646	Nowadays, physical punishment in schools has been an big national issue in Korea.	0
1002647	But when we arrived at Singapore, we excited at every thing.	0
1002648	Drivers should not be allowed to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1002649	So, for these reason, I agree that pepole don't need to use their real name on the Internet.	0
1002650	so i think that physical punishment give too much damage to both a teacher and a student.	0
1002651	The punishments hardly made us look back and think about our faults.	0
1002652	First, population is not what the army needs and second, there are some talented people whose talents should not be wasted and used for the society.	0
1002653	If they have the proper right, there is no reason not to use their real name on the internet.	0
1002654	If these is too hard for women.	0
1002655	It has special meaning that stay calm and grasp how to get thing done for me.	0
1002656	If teacher's punishment is so strong to dipress student's right, it becomes another problem.	0
1002657	Animal feel smaller pain than human beings.	0
1002658	he is very generous man, so all my school student love him and envy our class.	0
1002659	So when students fault the rule teacher have power of physical punishment to childen for korea's good education system.	0
1002660	I usually wake up late on Saturdays, because I have to wake up early in weekdays.	0
1002661	So I think we should not allow people to use a celluar phone while driving.	0
1002662	Also when I worry about my grade, she advised me and cheered me.	0
1002663	The special thing for our family is a photobook.	0
1002664	However, contrary to this idea, I like Mathematics best in high school.	0
1002665	For these reasons, I believe smoking should be banned in all public buildings.	0
1002666	It is clearly a right choice and should be placed earlier.	0
1002667	Also, some parents worry that teachers would punish their children physically just because teachers feel bad or hate their children.	0
1002668	so all Korean men should not be forced to complete military service.	0
1002669	The students who were given the physical punishment to their teachers are usually more rute to their teachers than the students who were given the nonphysical punishment to their teachers.	0
1002670	Physical punishment in school is obviously something bad, useless, and harmful to children.	0
1002671	It contains the pictures my family took when we had special occasions or took a trip to somewhere.	0
1002672	Banning cell phone while driving may prevent a lot of accidents including big one to small fender bender.	0
1002673	So using realname on the internet is not the real solution.	0
1002674	We have the right to do things to save our life.	0
1002675	And the cigarette smoke is too bad for young children because they are not grown enogh.	0
1002676	Because I was foreign language high scool student, there was not enough time to release a stress from study.	0
1002677	And she had more attentions about student's university.	0
1002678	The teacher wanted to have discussion freely and without any distraction.	0
1002679	My father said that smoking in public buildings was okay when he was young.	0
1002680	I think that's why math becomes my best subject.	0
1002681	And I often go shopping with my friends, or exercise together.	0
1002682	My best freinds are high school classmates.	0
1002683	Human isn't meet these condition.	0
1002684	Additionally, smoking is bad for the earth, too.	0
1002685	Not only me but also every people around him looks happy when get along with him.	0
1002686	To enhance the quality of lives there animal experiments are essential.	0
1002687	Statistically drivers who use cellular phones while driving occurs car accident frequently as much as drivers who drunk alchohol.	0
1002688	So they can do every bad things on the Internet.	0
1002689	Also, there are many advantages when people surf the Internet with their real name.	0
1002690	Of course animals aren't here in Earth for human.	0
1002691	if i have a chance , i go to USA.	0
1002692	She speaks her opinion to other people frankly.	0
1002693	I recorded the first grade in math when i was in 1 grade.	0
1002694	We must know teachers punish their students not because they are hate students but because they really love students.	0
1002695	we first go to 'Jagalchi market'.	0
1002696	He always talked about the theories in easy way with some metaphoes and those made me have interest in the chemistry.	0
1002697	However, it isn't necessary to have so many soldiers.	0
1002698	It is yours But Don't damage others.	0
1002699	At last I got my money for working, so I bought a mp3 player.	0
1002700	There were several reasons for this.	0
1002701	Also it can brings big problems like fire since smokers don't care about the lefted cigaretts and throw it anywhere if smoking in the buildings is allowed.	0
1002702	They feel they are free.	0
1002703	Some of the teachers believe that the physical punishment will make their student alter their behaviors.	0
1002704	so i want to go england.	0
1002705	First of all, It can protect people from expressing their opinion.	0
1002706	But first appeared handsfree was not so convenient, it has some problems like sometimes not working, should touching cellular phones to calling, must needing places to put, etc.	0
1002707	she is good at communicationg skills and humors, so she makes me relax.	0
1002708	If cellular phone is ringing while driving, you get the phone(if you can) and talk to the opponent that you are now driving so you will call back when you stop driving.	0
1002709	No one can not live alone.	0
1002710	But I didn't have a chance to see their huge and beautiful nature ever.	0
1002711	And prepair for unity of Han peninsula.	0
1002712	When teacher gives an assignment and says nothing about penalty, actually, a lot of students don't do it.	0
1002713	But in aspect of teachers, it was not that happy news.	0
1002714	She helped me very much because my failed subject was English.	0
1002715	Of course the war won't be able to happen.	0
1002716	I am not smoker but I think that smoking is very very bad and many people who don't smoking hate smoking air.	0
1002717	In the animals world, strong animal is granted to eating other animals but no animal feels the guilty for this action because its a matter of his survivor.	0
1002718	I made some pen pals in U.	0
1002719	Teachers are people who pass the education exam hard and make an effort of good teacher for a long time.	0
1002720	But human's life is more important for me.	0
1002721	Just punishing misbehaving students cannot make this goal.	0
1002722	Second, I think, the change of 2 years of military service to 1 years is also a good way to satisfy the Korean men.	0
1002723	A month ago, my family took a family photo.	0
1002724	Also military service makes men more responsible.	0
1002725	For example, one company must select one person.	0
1002726	If we use internet legally, our life will be better than yesterday.	0
1002727	like that way many people really hate to be forced to complete it.	0
1002728	Especially, I interested in western philosophy and aesthetics so I wanted to study philosophy on my major.	0
1002729	I don't like teaching on Sturday since people usually go on a trip during the weekends.	0
1002730	Children who can easily contact the cigarrett may be interested in smoking and then can start smoking.	0
1002731	We can just stop there and answer the phones.	0
1002732	We have killed animals to get something we want.	0
1002733	It follows several disadvantages, then the number of smokers is expected to be shrinked.	0
1002734	If smoking is uaually done in public buildings, smell of smoking is absorbed to fabric of building and it makes strange smell.	0
1002735	Their on-line language hurts other people's mind and it has continued other people suiside.	0
1002736	If that goes worse and worse, teachers would not have any ways to control the students who does not obey school rules and disciplines.	0
1002737	And in period, i disscused my futere life with my friend, parents, teacher.	0
1002738	It was said that "The human lives go first", by many peoples.	0
1002739	Bad thing is that now many teachers can't.	0
1002740	Just kinds of animals are a little different from two uses.	0
1002741	My favorit subject is math.	0
1002742	For these reasons, I like Math most than any other subject in high school.	0
1002743	She tell me math is most easy subject in high school curriculum beacause it more and more easier when I 'm interested and study.	0
1002744	And I'm interested with art and achitect.	0
1002745	and she have many eye drop.	0
1002746	So I want to buy Japan clothes.	0
1002747	Some people in educational area suggested some ways of controling the students, but the result shows that there is no way that is more effective.	0
1002748	After the physical punishment was dissappeared, many student are very rude and unpolite.	0
1002749	So punishing physically is kind of violating our society rules.	0
1002750	In case many medical experiments are happened.	0
1002751	The first and the most important reason is that using a cell phone during driving is really dangerous for both drivers and pedestrians.	0
1002752	Second, If we use our real name, Internet users can be more friendly than case of using fake name.	0
1002753	I think two opinion has a right thing partially.	0
1002754	From now i also plan to do valuable things on Saturdays.	0

1002758	Then we will be annoyed with him or her.	0
1002759	They only realize that they did wrong at that time and forget after the punishment.	0
1002760	Also Korean men distrust Korea.	0
1002761	It will bring a reception and can be a reason of fight	0
1002762	So I think animals 'MUST' be used to ex	0
1002763	I am still writing that novel and my readers are increasing.	0
1002764	And he will not take other's pencils whether you are there or not.	0
1002765	Singapore people boast their cleaness and dignity for the nation.	0
1002766	The teacher hit my head in his class by my ball.	0
1002767	There are two reasons.	0
1002768	I get up at 2pm.	0
1002769	So I usually stay at home and do other stuff such as translating in these days.	0
1002770	Sometimes I play with my friends.	0
1002771	Animal experiments is basically needed in medical development but it should be done in manners and respectation towards animals.	0
1002772	I already learned Chinesse when I was middle school student.	0
1002773	This travel is the most joyful thing in this vacation.	0
1002774	In teacher's shoes, They also have the right to live as human being and work at good environment.	0
1002775	If drivers automobiles shouldn't be allowed to use celluar phones while driving,She have many obstacles in working.	0
1002776	If people don't accept legal things, they can be punished by law.	0
1002777	I usually spend saturdays doing vollunteer work.	0
1002778	and, It can be a national power.	0
1002779	Why occur this accident.	0
1002780	Than I would walk and sports game in park which I eailiy go to with my familly or friend.	0
1002781	Speaking frankly, I always happy in everywhere in Saturdays because of the fact that I am free with uninteresting academies.	0
1002782	So, It is great chance to me to go to the U.	0
1002783	She doesn't tell a lie to me.	0
1002784	I tried to concentrate all the lectures she held, and studyied a lot more than any other subjects.	0
1002785	I especially want to visit New York, and Los Angeles.	0
1002786	When I am so boring or sad or alone, I see and play them.	0
1002787	I think that people must use their real name on the Internet.	0
1002788	But we cannot invite that in North korea.	0
1002789	And it is known well that indirect smoking is more harmful then direct smoking.	0
1002790	It is unfair not to allow the addictive to smoke anywhere in all public buildings.	0
1002791	Introverted children are less social and might have difficulty in doing or telling something (since they think that he or she will be punished if someone made mistake while doing that).	0
1002792	And we know nowadays more and more buildings don't allow people smoke in buildings.	0
1002793	One month ago, we went to Hang-ill temple which is known as one of the greatest sunrise places in Korea.	0
1002794	Being forced to complete military service at that age is like "a big rock" on the straight, new road.	0
1002795	In the last, my family and their family are like big family.	0
1002796	This is my opinion.	0
1002797	It's fun to listen her story.	0
1002798	And when I feel so hard or blue, I always go to her.	0
1002799	And that night we went to singing room so we had a good time.	0
1002800	You are not alone in public buildings.	0
1002801	Because there are two reasons for this.	0
1002802	and I decided to go to board every winter vacation.	0
1002803	When she was driving carefully, she was pretty good and did not make any mistakes.	0
1002804	He used images which was in text.	0
1002805	Second, diary becomes the report of my travel.	0
1002806	However, after veterinarians built up cognitive knowledge on animal, it not only saved human's rights but also fostered further medical research.	0
1002807	In the trial were English ability test, running test, and test of ability to control the tennis ball.	0
1002808	Smoking in public buildings is like hurt other people, so when you smoking who must go smoking room.	0
1002809	It would cause disasterous car accident.	0
1002810	And people who don't follow the law should be given a proper punishment.	0
1002811	The punishment also consist of so light physical touching.	0
1002812	My favorite American drama is LOST.	0
1002813	This is japan is good democratic nation.	0
1002814	This not only protect users' contents but also helps for more good contents in the future.	0
1002815	Lee's class couldn't get that high scores.	0
1002816	While driving, drivers' concentration is the most important attitude that drivers must have.	0
1002817	I also like to solve math problem.	0
1002818	And the doing that bad student can be so big problem.	0
1002819	Now I give you a example.	0
1002820	Internet's big advantage is the other person don't know who I am.	0
1002821	We have to live together.	0
1002822	Of course Korea is different with these countries.	0
1002823	yes, it should be allowed in all schools.	0
1002824	king is symbol of the nation.	0
1002825	However, it's Internet's character and using real name can't help this phenomenon, so I disagree about policy that people should use their real name on the web sites.	0
1002826	Computer simulating is good example.	0
1002827	It is just one part of human psychology.	0
1002828	When we asked something about Japan to japanese, They always answered our questions sincerely with smiles.	0
1002829	They have to do expreriments to cure sick people and also they consider animals' life.	0
1002830	We can meet many strangers, and they will be our friends.	0
1002831	It's takes too much time for smokers to get out of the buidings every time they want to smoke.	0
1002832	Recently many people think that conscripting all men is out-dated military system.	0
1002833	If i have a chance to travel, I will go to Japan first.	0
1002834	It was came with big subeffect.	0
1002835	But military service made him different.	0
1002836	Smoking, however, is bad not only for people who smoke, but also for people who don't smoke; just being near to people who are smoking can be a trigger of a bad diseases.	0
1002837	Job market needs proficient workers, but after 2 years of miltary service, men cannot do anything proficiently that job market needs.	0
1002838	To illustrate, the authorities of medical experiment would be responsible for wrong happenings on humans.	0
1002839	Finally public buildings are used by every one.	0
1002840	I think animals and expendable for medical causes.	0
1002841	Of course there is a right to the non-smoking people.	0
1002842	First, he teached us Economics by which I think I can get a good grade in KSAT.	0
1002843	Not only that, forcing talented athletes to compelete military service would be a loss of nation.	0
1002844	Because they don't want people remember their name awful.	0
1002845	I and my family put many photos of ours often.	0
1002846	Teachers should make students understand why their behavior is wrong and why they should take physical punishment, not just make students frustrated.	0
1002847	And mind disabled students are also more stressful for physical punishment than before.	0
1002848	Of course sometimes we fight or cry.	0
1002849	And for curbing the use of cellular phones while driving, the law that forbidding to drive while using cellular phones should be enacted.	0
1002850	We don't have to do a physical punishment.	0
1002851	Furthermore, students who are used to physical punishment might misbehave to their teachers when physical punishment is forbidden.	0
1002852	Internet users meet many other users, but people hardly know other users' names because people use their nicknames, not their real names on the internet.	0
1002853	Second, the physical punishment is opressing the individual's right.	0
1002854	I think that point is another charming point.	0
1002855	becasuse she has nice appearence.	0
1002856	I was embarrassed.	0
1002857	But it is more justifable to say that smokers' rights should be limited if too many non-smokers' rights to feel clean and be healthy are disturbed by the smoking of some smokers.	0
1002858	In these days, there are so many deaths of people beacause of the bad words for them on the internet.	0
1002859	Almost people don't want to smell smoking.	0
1002860	Fortunately we were same class for three years.	0
1002861	We can understand their hunger and help them by speaking and lienig.	0
1002862	because an atomic bomb can blow up the city in the minute.	0
1002863	You listen to the conversation and think about other thing that happend last night just a moment so you miss some words actors said.	0
1002864	however smoking is bad to people is fact, and public building is everybody's thing.	0
1002865	But I think that kind of punishment just makes student be passive to teacher's advice.	0
1002866	Of course, there are many brave man that can write their own with no hesitation.	0
1002867	Kids are small, so we are not see kids.	0
1002868	I have lived in japan since 1993.	0
1002869	We know that we originally have the right to express what we think and feel, as long as it's not harmful to the other "people"-not government or social-leading powers.	0
1002870	Because the researchers are people too, there would be no one with the experiment controlling animals' lives.	0
1002871	For example, a drug is not harmful for animal.	0
1002872	Every media has special trait.	0
1002873	If someone smokes in a public area, the area will be filled with smoke with unhealthy chemitrical thing.	0
1002874	I think this problem happens because keyboard warriors think the victims of their writings don't know who wrote this writings.	0
1002875	And we make our food.	0
1002876	So the best replacement of human is a rat.	0
1002877	So, I could be an active student from a just shy student.	0
1002878	Think about one situation.	0
1002879	For example, high school students, who are big and tall enough and almost have same physical power as adults, beat teachers and are absent to schools.	0
1002880	However they were very good at study, so i had to study to become their friend.	0
1002881	IT was too dangerous and harmful.	0
1002882	First, children are not perfect people, which means that adults should make them a right view of the world, direct them to good ways and can hurt dreams of children.	0
1002883	That value is public peple's health!	0
1002884	The highscool, is one of the most important period in our life so freinds or teachers are important too.	0
1002885	For example, the effect of the medicines can be simulated through computers thesedays.	0
1002886	Even when we are talking, having diffrent states, he listens to mine first.	0
1002887	So, each profit unions will prepare these information taking war.	0
1002888	It is agument like a dull.	0
1002889	So mouses can be used in medical experiments.	0
1002890	To explain, I always wanted to enter Yonsei University from a time as I was a middle school student.	0
1002891	Therefore I think that drivers of cars should not be allowed to use their celluar phones.	0
1002892	When people use cellular phones while driving, their concentration on driving is separated.	0
1002893	It can cause many diseases like cancer and even can make people die.	0
1002894	Therefore, I think using phones while driving is related to the rate of car accident.	0
1002895	That reason made me a thought that "English is so fun!".	0
1002896	Students do not matter what the teacher is saying and just ignore what they told.	0
1002897	And they said, "Without physical punishment, we can make better school life.	0
1002898	If teachers couldn't have physical punishment to thier students, they would lose their power.	0
1002899	And there are many teachers who is very wild.	0
1002900	I heard several news and read aritcles on papers that there are a lot of side effects caused by the abolition of the physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1002901	It's really cruel things that although we know animals can feel sufferings, we have them feel that.	0
1002902	Thus they don't get hurt on their heart which many parents mostly worry about.	0
1002903	Recently, peoples have cellular phone, for it is easy to use and useful good.	0
1002904	but our team member steal my item.	0
1002905	Military service is an inevitable thing to make a nation stable.	0
1002906	Physical punishment is not the answer.	0
1002907	And 2 minor car crash because of the frozen road.	0
1002908	and i think the using real name is can be means of social power.	0
1002909	My girlfreind is so busy on weekdays so I only can date with my girlfriend on weekends.	0
1002910	He always gave me advice, and it helped me a lot.	0
1002911	That is, the disposed cigarettes can be lit again on the buildings' floor and make a fire.	0
1002912	Also we should be able to protect our privacies.	0
1002913	Although banning smoking in all public buildins can harm a personal previlege to smokers, but there are enough reasons about banning smokings in all public buildings.	0
1002914	I do many things on my Saturday holiday!	0
1002915	If physical punishment is used properly, it can be a good tool which can guide students.	0
1002916	Some people might assert that since worldwide statistics says physical punishment actually improves students' degree of academic achievement punishment should be maintained as long as school remains as a place for 'studying'.	0
1002917	Thus, smokers offend the rule and smokes in buildings illigally.	0
1002918	So I must bear it everyday when I go outside.	0
1002919	It is natural that drivers of automobiles should not be allowed to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1002920	But without using animals in medical experiments, we are not sure some medicine and medical device.	0
1002921	These problems didn't exist under physical punishment.	0
1002922	As a good people we are, we should not use animals in medical experiments.	0
1002923	So he often told good things in class to make students study on their own.	0
1002924	But We can't consider everything.	0
1002925	Every citizen in country has freedom but also has responsibilty about their act.	0
1002926	So the number of soldiers is not important.	0
1002927	Not being in their real life about 2 years is not easy and I heard it takes time for them to adjust to society.	0
1002928	It is original real variety entertainment program in Korea.	0
1002929	So, it will be not good for two things.	0
1002930	Last reason is in PE class I cant learn team work.	0
1002931	There is many type of military service so they could do their acadmic work with military service together.	0
1002932	Also corporal punishment is effective for most of students.	0
1002933	second, indirect smoking is also very harmful.	0
1002934	But most important thing is a love.	0
1002935	It can harm for their children.	0
1002936	But when we are on internet, we do not think that we don't have responsibilty which is demanded out the internet.	0
1002937	First, somking in public area is something actucally personal.	0
1002938	The most interesting thing that happened to me this past vacation was teaching young students.	0
1002939	So i really want to visit other Europe's country, tood.	0
1002940	Second, I think men will have a handicap after completing military service.	0
1002941	They can escape by using money.	0
1002942	People could do everythings they want and All of the people have a right to do.	0
1002943	Altough there are so many smoking people in the world, public buildings are place that so various people use.	0
1002944	In this experience, How can I write my favorite subject is other thing?	0
1002945	Many rumors can be recognized as true in the internet and it make issues.	0
1002946	Of course, smokers have the right to smoke if they choose to, however to an extent where they wouldn't invade other people's right.	0
1002947	it does not need much concentration on cellular phones.	0
1002948	But if we respect smokers' right fully, smokers will smoke in all of the world and right of non-smokers who hate this can't be protected at all.	0
1002949	He is same positions with me.	0
1002950	So these days I hang out with friends.	0
1002951	Second, if they are not using own automobiles, they can ignore other people.	0
1002952	It makes us more friendly.	0
1002953	And he likes music just like me.	0
1002954	So even in these days, Korea is in the wartime.	0
1002955	Every each cell completely interacts toghether and has different roles.	0
1002956	There are many smokers in Korea and the number of them are increazing.	0
1002957	Some people says animals are important, so we must not use animals in medical experiment.	0
1002958	Should physical punishment blamed for violating students' right, why not school itself?	0
1002959	It hurts honor of our country.	0
1002960	I think it's a mind-attitude problem.	0
1002961	It can make person murderer in one moment who help people in trouble and donate his property with smile.	0
1002962	For instance, I tried to download the music on the Internet.	0
1002963	Third, Driver always sees pedesterian.	0
1002964	To use real name can show Internet crime the easy way to make it.	0
1002965	and My body is healthful!	0
1002966	so i was interested in math and love the math when i was high school student.	0
1002967	Suggest one smoker is smoking , he takes the filtered smoke.	0
1002968	But now, people think that physical punishment is a only wise solution to educate.	0
1002969	And finally if we pactice experiment not human but also animals benefit these experiment.	0
1002970	This is why i say that such treatments should be allowed in school.	0
1002971	So don't add to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1002972	My firend said that isn't stange, it is normal.	0
1002973	Dogs, rats.	0
1002974	Many studies show that using a cell phone while driving is as dangerous as drunken driving, or can be more serious.	0
1002975	Third, since smoking is addictive, people who don't smoke can smoke by seeing smoking people.	0
1002976	There are many reasons that I like my best friend.	0
1002977	If students have difficulty dealing with presenting personal opinion to their teacher with confidence, there will be no interactions between teachers and their students.	0
1002978	there is no reason all Korean men to go to military service.	0
1002979	I think using phone while driving is same that not seat belt while driving.	0
1002980	I'm not totally disagree with the organization.	0
1002981	And somebody suggest that the man who complete military service can't be given advantage in many exams.	0
1002982	They are suspended and even expelled from their school.	0
1002983	There are several reasons for this.	0
1002984	As a result, politicians knew the problem of the prohibition, and they changed the law to allow indirect physical punishment such as running the playground, putting hands over the head, or washing the school restroom.	0
1002985	Some people think that animals should be treated well as live things.	0
1002986	Next, we have to remeber that Korea is in special situation.	0
1002987	I have a special thing.	0
1002988	When we have experimest, Should human be used?	0
1002989	For these reasons, I think our ananymous system in internet is better than real name system.	0
1002990	After physical punishment is prohibited, students don't follow teachers guidance more, they don't care whether a teacher comes or not and just do their work.	0
1002991	Thanks to him, I could get good scores on many exams and the speaking contest.	0
1002992	My best friend is elementary school friend; Seong Min, Han.	0
1002993	At that time, I was so confused because I didn't know what I was wanting to be and what I had to do for my future.	0
1002994	I think they should feel the same pain that they do to the others.	0
1002995	In my opinion, however, such medical experiments are necessary for the following two reasons even if it may harm the animals' rights.	0
1002996	I have no idea about the developments.	0
1002997	Secondly, she never ignores someone.	0
1002998	So physical punishments should be allowed in some schools.	0
1002999	If he did't give me brave, I was having a problem in choosing university.	0
1003000	I saw movie last month which Sue Ae is main character.	0
1003001	In short, I strongly agree to the opinion that people should use their real name.	0
1003002	At first, I was very nervous because I entered university one year later than normal students.	0
1003003	It is soccer league in England.	0
1003004	And there are some religions that prohibit murdering, and learning to murder that is happening in military.	0
1003005	What i mean is that a large number of celebrities's sons and entertainers don't go to finish their military service.	0
1003006	Smoking should be banned in all public buildings.	0
1003007	Still there are so many people suffering of not curing diseases in the world.	0
1003008	Finally It'll be terrible.	0
1003009	It can only disappear when all people`s think be changed.	0
1003010	But because it has big disadvantage to use it, I think we should not permit using real name on the Internet.	0
1003011	Last, the acceptance of using cellular phones while driving makes people think that driving car is not the thing that require carefulness.	0
1003012	And people living in Australia was all kind and polite.	0
1003013	That is very famous because of chicken.	0
1003014	There are not academy.	0
1003015	So, naturally i like the teacher who teaches scinence.	0
1003016	but it is too hard to met him.	0
1003017	We need to know we are responsible for our saying.	0
1003018	So they can make that actions repeatedly without thinking it's fault.	0
1003019	I think animals which killed by it are so poor.	0
1003020	First of all i think that drivers of automobiles not be allowed to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1003021	For example, my friend's school is poiint rule.	0
1003022	These behaves are happened because there is no way to controll them by banning punishments, and students uses this situation.	0
1003023	They play phone game and talk with friends in class.	0
1003024	There were a lot of chance to meet with various people.	0
1003025	So people leave bad messages just in curiousity or to do harm to the famous people.	0
1003026	I like people who have conscience.	0
1003027	when hard problem is correct, I have a accomplishment and enjoy,and when hare problem is correct, I feel that I challenge more hard problems.	0
1003028	IP means the address in each of personal computer.	0
1003029	Then, we went to ride a train heading the top of mountain.	0
1003030	Also, he was an excellent teacher in mathematics.	0
1003031	Physical punishment has many advantage but it has more disadvantage.	0
1003032	So, that's why the animal experiment is needed.	0
1003033	also, I want to see polite teacher to student.	0
1003034	At Yonsei preuniversity, I could many brothers, sisters.	0
1003035	When problems are solving, I feel great happiness and feel mathmatical beauty.	0
1003036	However, given that he or she keeps focusing on driving without mobile phone, the driver could be manipulate a car more carefully.	0
1003037	Their opinion is so correct but I have a different opinion.	0
1003038	Finally I wonder how much pride the english have.	0
1003039	My favorite teacher in my high school was my math teacher in 11th grade.	0
1003040	So i think smokers should recognize the fact and stop smoking in public buildings, and also at other public places like bus-stops.	0
1003041	So I think my photo which was shoted when I was young is special object	0
1003042	To tell the truth, it was my first experience to visit Jeju island.	0
1003043	Or, who can claim like that they can receive a call after they parked their car the side road.	0
1003044	At that time he became my mentor and helped me a lot.	0
1003045	We are lucky because we can meet after the long high school years.	0
1003046	Moreover, they state some examples that APPLE company in America have a good profit by allowing non-real name system.	0
1003047	they know each other's real name.	0
1003048	Ko - who was my class teacher when I was 18-year-old.	0
1003049	because I love music.	0
1003050	Internet is tool to be did these.	0
1003051	Therefore before we do find new punishment, best punishment is physical punishment.	0
1003052	I like to go to Greece because there are a lot of heritages and clean nature.	0
1003053	So we remembered this time.	0
1003054	And it will be a problem for all students in class.	0
1003055	I envy him, because I am not good at excersize.	0
1003056	I think physical punishment should not be allowed in all schools because of 3 reasons.	0
1003057	And I think that the governments need to prohibit drivers from using a variety of goods for dirvers like hands free, blutoos function, becase using these goods is similar to using cellular phones on account of distracting drivers' concentration.	0
1003058	And I want to go to the Opera House.	0
1003059	Then, they will be a good student and they will enjoy studying.	0
1003060	Secondly, men thinks strictly when they complete millitary service.	0
1003061	There is the famous word, "spare the rod, spoil the child".	0
1003062	Military service asks goverment to sustain much cost, so goverment can't invest more cost for other parts including developing universe space, researching science, preserving nature.	0
1003063	Each people may have their own way of enjoying Saturday.	0
1003064	In army, they have to become one in the whole, and whole in the one.	0
1003065	First of all, it has many memories about my ex-boy friend.	0
1003066	Because of that drivers are not take care of the driving, so drivers will beat the people on the block.	0
1003067	There's ads on cigar case saying 'Smoke can eat up your lung'.	0
1003068	Like this, not using real name on the internet has some problem.	0
1003069	Secendly, I want to watch German football.	0
1003070	So people who use the Internet now may be not educated about danger of anonymous.	0
1003071	First, it would be hard to know many people's opinion if we use real name on the Internet.	0
1003072	I like meeting new people and playing with them.	0
1003073	At that time, students must obey to their teachers and teachers even had a threatening equipment to make students afraid of them.	0
1003074	You know why?	0
1003075	Moreover the cigarette's unextinguished flame leaves black and gray marks on the ground.	0
1003076	when we are in place where talk about some serious problems like politics or judging someone else, we have to use our real name.	0
1003077	The most reason I liked her was that we have a lot of commons.	0
1003078	No, I don't think drivers of automobiles shoud not be allowed to use cellular phones while they are driving.	0
1003079	Because I saw many people wrote bad words to another people not using their real name.	0
1003080	Using a cellular phones while driving is not problem if he or she is very concentrating on driving.	0
1003081	And it will be an solution for lessen the accidents conducted by automobiles.	0
1003082	The physical punishment is necessarry.	0
1003083	The bad smell from smokers mouth and their clothes could be annying to pepole who don't like smoking smell.	0
1003084	Using cellular phones while driving is dangerous, making bad relationship and being slow.	0
1003085	Without animal experiment, we don't know wheather there is any side effects.	0
1003086	I warn that teacher don't leave teacher's mission.	0
1003087	An object that has special meaning is letters from my friend who live in New York, United States now.	0
1003088	When some problems happen, he don't give it to other person.	0
1003089	but someday his wife have disease ;lung caner.	0
1003090	Second, Using one's real name on the Internet doesn't assure his or her privacy.	0
1003091	And I could concentrated on studying whenever I reminded about his saying.	0
1003092	We are very happy in Okinawa.	0
1003093	Korean men that finish the military service are recognized to other people and Korea society.	0
1003094	When I went to school, we were always hit by our teachers.	0
1003095	so students can't do bed thing if they want to go school.	0
1003096	Because the car come to the line that they want to change.	0
1003097	I'm not a smoker and I'm very upset when I'm near the smoking person.	0
1003098	At the wedding hall, I first set the table so that people could sit and be ready to watch the wedding.	0
1003099	And we all greed with that way, we accepted it.	0
1003100	But I didn`t believe the God`s love.	0
1003101	Even, they use earphone not to hold cell phones, it can be dangerous, too.	0
1003102	Physical scar can be cured, on the other hand, mental scar is difficult to be cured.	0
1003103	Second, I can write essay well through writting education in korean class.	0
1003104	But we must protact other people's right.	0
1003105	Most impressed thing about her is her smile.	0
1003106	Because of these, many men hate having military service.	0
1003107	I agree with them but I want to talk them not in public buildings because non-smokers have right to not inhale bad smoke.	0
1003108	Surely, mercyless punishment of children in school should not be justified.	0
1003109	I think all Korean men should be forced to complete military service to keep the number of soliders that can protect our country by dangers such an invading of North Korea.	0
1003110	It will be wondeful, If we have chances to protect both animals and people.	0
1003111	so our people's sound are smaller and smaller.	0
1003112	Animals and humans are connected to each other.	0
1003113	Also that does not improve children's real academic performance.	0
1003114	Even now I make a phone call to her very often.	0
1003115	When I visit Jagalchi fair a old waman was selling fishes.	0
1003116	So it is bad to all peolple.	0
1003117	I do not care whether they smoke or not unless they do harm me.	0
1003118	math teacher teached my math ablity and after i like math.	0
1003119	Some might say it is their own to decide their private matter.	0
1003120	We have to show the real name of each netizen.	0
1003121	Lots of famous universities are in USA.	0
1003122	And my answer is a note.	0
1003123	I like almost every story, including faction, novel, essay, and comic books.	0
1003124	At last, I think military service is another social work for Korean men.	0
1003125	But just and moderate punishment and punishment with love is needed for school, children and nation.	0
1003126	I think that it is not fair smoking is banned in all public buildings.	0
1003127	Actually, I hate the Math when I was 10 years old.	0
1003128	but we should consider sideeffects	0
1003129	We need our friends.	0
1003130	I agree that people must use their real name on the internet.	0
1003131	School should not just punish them physically, but should understand them in their shoes.	0
1003132	For this reasons, I disagree that people must show their real name on the Internet.	0
1003133	Although I do not like that kinds of punishment, it needs sometimes to teach students.	0
1003134	When you are driving, you need to think when you can drive if there is a traffic light and how you can drive to reach your destiny.	0
1003135	As I'm busy thesedays, I don't have much time except Saturday.	0
1003136	Since of them, it is the most special thing to us.	0
1003137	The last, In the night, I surffing the internet and talk with my friend on the nateon.	0
1003138	Medical experiments can help human?	0
1003139	This is not only killing character in the gossip but also real person.	0
1003140	Next day the fandom of 'S' log-in to the internet and find dancing girls' real identification.	0
1003141	If your family in the bad situation, you can call.	0
1003142	So I agree that if phisical punishment is necessary, it can be done.	0
1003143	of course, it is said that because of one person using cell phone, many people die together.	0
1003144	But if physical punishment is not allowed, students are not think teachers as their another parents.	0
1003145	If I have a chance to travel, I desire to go to China, especially Buk-Kyoung with my friends.	0
1003146	Finally I could enter the university thanks to her help.	0
1003147	Children are not different.	0
1003148	physical punishment should not be allowed in all schools.	0
1003149	If i have a chance to travel France, i would see that buildings and think a lot.	0
1003150	The Han peninsula's situation is complex.	0
1003151	Of course, there are a lot of advantages of using their real name, but there will be a serious problem when using their real name.	0
1003152	but, I think that physical punishment of childrem is needed.	0
1003153	I have a album.	0
1003154	Without concentrating on driving, they may lose control.	0
1003155	Just a little moment can bo realized.	0
1003156	There are some people worry about the wrong use of the punishment.	0
1003157	From Iraq war of United States to WWII in which the nuclear bomb was introduced, the development of massive-destructing weapons is still on going, wepons becoming much more disaterous.	0
1003158	Government and many citizen' effort will be needed, because of Korea's custom.	0
1003159	If I didn`t solve the math question, he cheer me up and say "Try again, and think diffrent way!"	0
1003160	so i will go that place and i want to take picture with my friends.	0
1003161	For my life, I will regard military service as a glory.	0
1003162	Because i heard that japan is developted country in ocean.	0
1003163	If we eliminate a course of experiments that use an animals, we cannot proof the effect of medicine we made.	0
1003164	For eaxample, bad people like murder and street fighters have to punish physicaly.	0
1003165	Considering that buildings are limited area that are covered with lots of materials, it is really dangerous if fire appears.	0
1003166	I think smoking should be banned in all public buildings.	0
1003167	If someone caught plague, should he or she come to public buildings?	0
1003168	The military service would be a crash to their deep belief.	0
1003169	So I think if people must use their real name on the Internet, they will become more responsible about what they write on the Internet.	0
1003170	So i like those in high school.	0
1003171	nowadays north korea attack our area and intense a lot of nation.	0
1003172	According to smoker's saying, smoking might give smokers release.	0
1003173	At last, with my best friends, we could tell and counsel every secret concerns and dream.	0
1003174	People who use a celluar phone while driving usually think that they can concentrate their driving even though they are using a cell phone.	0
1003175	For example, if you contact cigar smog long time you may take cancer.	0
1003176	Some people are worried about the national safety becuase of the decreasing number of national soldiers, but we already have successful models of elective military system.	0
1003177	And that opinion often makes the society healthy, and clean.	0
1003178	Korea also have good attackers.	0
1003179	Because he and I are so different, we can help each other and complement each other so that we can be a perfect duo.	0
1003180	In making sure some actions are wrong, and in making students actions change, physical punishment is the greatest, the oldest and the most efficient tool.	0
1003181	Smoking in all public buildings can effect harmful thing to non-smokers, because indirect-smoking is more dangerous than direct-smoiking to non-smokers.	0
1003182	When I got there, it was snowing.	0
1003183	On this course the physical punishment is needed.	0
1003184	But I have a different point of view.	0
1003185	We decided to go trip!	0
1003186	I have runed in front of my apartment and I exercised hollar hoof at the school.	0
1003187	We have a dog in our home, who is so cute.	0
1003188	In situation of formal websites, such as internet newspaper, sites where people debate about heavy social issues, it should be recommended to use their real name.	0
1003189	For this reason, students admired their teachers and atmostphere of the class was better.	0
1003190	They don't know there problem for there y	0
1003191	Because economoics have much to do with ordinary life.	0
1003192	not only the driver was died, but it also hurt other people or even kill them.	0
1003193	Before I met him, I was just one of those who are always tired of doing activities, even playing with friends, but after I met him and became a friend of him, I gradually started to think why I have lived my life so meaninglessly.	0
1003194	In the world, nothing is free in meaning everyting pays its resonsibilty.	0
1003195	Thanks to him, I could think about life more profoundly.	0
1003196	I went to the theater in Daehakro with my friends.	0
1003197	One day, she gave her necklace to me and said "I really thank for your help so i want to give it to you."	0
1003198	Because we have to be the man exactly like us in real world.	0
1003199	The most interesting thing that happened in my past vacation was my familly trip to Hong	0
1003200	If smokers want to smoke, they have to go out public buildings.	0
1003201	Most Korean women even do not know the basic information about the military and the behavior in emergency.	0
1003202	Moreover, animals can easily bear new offsprings, but humans cannot.	0
1003203	And finally they grow up, have a job, marry, go to millitary, they will kick or hit their wife, son or many kinds of people having a connection.	0
1003204	But without physical punishment, students say "Yes, I will not do these things.	0
1003205	Smoking should be banned in all public buildings where all kinds of people visit.	0
1003206	I think that the television has special meaning in my family unlike other family.	0
1003207	Some opponents may say "even though the experiments save lots of animal, it is not 'natural'."	0
1003208	If we must use own real name on the Internet, First bad reply culture on the Internet will disappear.	0
1003209	All and all, I strongly belive that because smoking can make a bad effect on people's health and it could make working environment bad, smoking in public building should be banned.	0
1003210	In Korea, people's personal information is saved in database.	0
1003211	It focuses automatically and permits us to take good pictures.	0
1003212	We've become familiar with teaching games.	0
1003213	I believe that the reason for this is that people can act on the internet by not using their real names, because many sites accept people to post in their other names or just their user ID.	0
1003214	Moreover, they become healtheir than before as they exercise everyday in there.	0
1003215	My father became a man who does not fear of anything and learned the importance of RESPONSIBILITY.	0
1003216	Some people say that true canversation with young students is impossible.	0
1003217	First of all, because even if there are vertical positions in school, teachers and students, it is not the allowing sign that teachers can hit students freely.	0
1003218	Some teachers lament that students these days do not obey the rule or the teachers and claim that they should be physically punished to stop their deviant behavior.	0
1003219	Therefore I think that smoking should be banned in all buildings, and the goverment should help smokers stop smoking.	0
1003220	Although some people contend that using real name can also have side effect, it's side effects are relatively small when they are compared with not using real name.	0
1003221	In environment sides, that project destroys the biology system and organization.	0
1003222	Finally, we talk with other people in Internet like face to face situations.	0
1003223	But although We had good time, we didn't meet together anymore.	0
1003224	How many student can maturally think of there studying and teacher?	0
1003225	I go to travel everywhere.	0
1003226	Most of all, our house is very special meaning for my family.	0
1003227	As a result, moral destruction happens so often in society and moral stabilization goes down.	0
1003228	At night, I am studying english.	0
1003229	This task uses fore-part of our brain.	0
1003230	Having a dream and making a dream come true is the imporant thing.	0
1003231	At first, I went to a small mountain at Gayangdong named 'Goong mountain'.	0
1003232	The policy that makes only Korean male join military force is unfair.	0
1003233	And there i will listen to the Sofrano's wonderful voice.	0
1003234	However, I believe the advantages of using real name far exceed the disadvantages.	0
1003235	For example, because people don't know the name is used by other person, they will swear not hacker, but the name-used user.	0
1003236	In conclusion, It is better not to force all Korean men to complete military service.	0
1003237	However after making medicine, it cannot be produced rightaway.	0
1003238	They claim that it is their right to have a religion they want, and according to it, they should not go to the military service.	0
1003239	The world that maked by number is uncovered by Math.	0
1003240	If we continuely put them aside, there'll be many victims finally.	0
1003241	My yong student is lived in North Korea.	0
1003242	So I had great time.	0
1003243	When Drivers do not focus on their driving, It leads to accident.	0
1003244	I think that physical punishment in schools have not to bel allowed.	0
1003245	I really enjoyed his lecture.	0
1003246	He listens carefully when i have a problem, and he gives me a helpful advice.	0
1003247	What is even more scary is that those car accidents can take other innocent victims' lives.	0
1003248	I maintain that all Korean men should complete military service.	0
1003249	1~0.	0
1003250	There are some celebrities who hurt their feelings and commited suicide because of these insensible comments.	0
1003251	For example, when I was a middle school student, some students did a bad thing.	0
1003252	she is the strongest girl around the people I ever met, and I admire her very much.	0
1003253	For example, they hit students - students went hospital, so the students can't go school about two weeks.	0
1003254	Choi jin sil's suicide can be a example and suicide that because of bed reply is improving now.	0
1003255	I think it is wrong.	0
1003256	And, he and I have many common habits.	0
1003257	So people have used animals for a lot of time.	0
1003258	But he is my mento too.	0
1003259	The clinic is located at public building, Sang Gong conference.	0
1003260	Using Internet users' real name will boost the situation.	0
1003261	It would be very dangerous.	0
1003262	For example, now in korea, diseases in cow and pig appear and kill lots of animals.	0
1003263	In fact some researches suggest that when drivers use cellular phones while driving, they couldn't concentrate on calling as well as driving.	0
1003264	In that way, we can remove the obstacle for using Internet.	0
1003265	Third reason is he understand me.	0
1003266	People also have to care more about the important things like traffic ligts, and they have to remind themselves that using cell phones means 'danger'	0
1003267	At first, I just liked her personality, but later, I could love both her lesson and the subject.	0
1003268	I also think it is ridiculous to criticize on animal experiment while eating cows and chickens.	0
1003269	Therefore, when drivers use cell phones while driving, there is only one hand left to hold the handle.	0
1003270	because we live in a same apartment and my father and his father's job is a same.	0
1003271	my favorite teacher is yong-hun lee, my third grade math teacher.	0
1003272	I like my math teacher in my high school.	0
1003273	If two country became united country, men forced to complete military service would not be need to our country any longer.	0
1003274	And, teacher can be respectable from their students, and students can be grow to very kind and sensible person.	0
1003275	I got bumped by the unstopping car, whose driver was talking to a cellular phone.	0
1003276	Nevertheless, we cannot ignore the freedom and rights of smokers completely.	0
1003277	At last, I'd like to mention about Korea's these days' situation.	0
1003278	and never accept cheating not to go arm.	0
1003279	Long time ago, I saw the news about undirect smoking.	0
1003280	To be specific, he voluteer for people who need his help.	0
1003281	If you think that, how violent is justified?".	0
1003282	As a result, drivers of autmobiles should not be allowed to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1003283	But I do not agree hard physical punishment of children in school.	0
1003284	If they don't do any physical punishments,both teacher and student will not hurt.	0
1003285	Country with 100% non smokers would be perfect, but we know it cannot be real.	0
1003286	When it comes to this subjects, people usually may think about right of animals to live.	0
1003287	Then i like math.	0
1003288	It is becoming much more muti-usable.	0
1003289	He is a kind of that guy.	0
1003290	But, still physical punishment is needed by our society.	0
1003291	What we can do our best is that choice the another idea, too.	0
1003292	I liked physics the best.	0
1003293	It is evident that in our current society military service has a tremendous importance in our lives.	0
1003294	One of the reason I like this subject is enjoyment.	0
1003295	As a reasult I reccomand for physical punishment to be allowed in schools only for these situation.	0
1003296	Of course, sometimes physical punishment can overuse.	0
1003297	When our goal was only taking KSAT successfully, he decided to be a global engineer and learned Japanese to study abroad.	0
1003298	then they decide suicide is better than living or they become outsider.	0
1003299	Smoking in the public building is like poisoning it.	0
1003300	When one student does some bad things, teachers can get more effect by talking the student, not giving him physical punishment.	0
1003301	His name is Sin-bok Kang.	0
1003302	If there is a hell, I'm sure that it(high school) is one part of it.	0
1003303	If a person do not hold the handle with two arms, it is more dangerous to make a turn.	0
1003304	If you are a teacher and meet some kids who aren't listening to you at all.	0
1003305	While driving, drivers must concentrate on many traffic situations such as pedestrians, cars, traffic lights, etc.	0
1003306	It is same in Internet and real life.	0
1003307	Beause when they used in medical experiments, we are medical techniqe develope.	0
1003308	In school, there is many troubles between teachers and students.	0
1003309	This trip will be a good teacher for me through years, and I will look back over this experience someday in future.	0
1003310	After I and my brother were born, when we could not sleep well, she often played lullabies by her guitar.	0
1003311	But when she class stasted, I could understand math accurately and much.	0
1003312	Korean young men deserve the same opportunity for using their time and energy to where they want to as young men in another countries.	0
1003313	In conclusion, disagree to general opinion, people are don't think animal and human are same.	0
1003314	If a person doesn't have these devices, they can stop the car on the side of the road and do whatever they need to do.	0
1003315	On the other hand, physical punishment gives children pains what so called 'passive pain'.	0
1003316	We always go to school together.	0
1003317	But this method is not useful because it lasts very short, and worse, it produces violence.	0
1003318	And this news take the some expri.	0
1003319	So I want to go Batican one more, and like to see the works.	0
1003320	Third, in fact, my brother and I go same university, and we knew that we're qualified for university through the computer.	0
1003321	They should have responsibility of taking care of their students.	0
1003322	But it never happened.	0
1003323	in that sense, i like P.E. most.	0
1003324	I think the people's careless mind is the biggiest cause of that.	0
1003325	driving have to do in confortable condition, not high or low.	0
1003326	So I really want to meet them in Japan.	0
1003327	I think The answer why Internet can spread all over the world in very short time is we don't need to use our real name.	0
1003328	Because this experiment is good result for people sometimes, but some cases, this test will give people serious impact.	0
1003329	The second hand smoke is more harmful.	0
1003330	With beginning of a new year, many people make new year plan to quit smoking.	0
1003331	It's skin is hard or soft.	0
1003332	i'm supposed to study english because of surviving this world	0
1003333	Second, Not only human but also animals can have interest in curing their disease.	0
1003334	And the person who is gossiped are not hurt on mind.	0
1003335	In this situation that students' thought and value is growing, student can be hurt on very small things.	0
1003336	I'm so sorry because I couldn't take this test very well.	0
1003337	Some people say that on the Internet, it is better to use virtual name.	0
1003338	So, children become extrovert and can make many friends.	0
1003339	Almost every social Internet site, like DCinside, is fertile because they have anonymous system.	0
1003340	In recent studies, third-smoking(Indirect smoking) is more harmful than direct smoking.	0
1003341	So my mathmatics point is so good.	0
1003342	they don't afraid of this punishment.	0
1003343	Smoking ban is essential for the public good for the following reasons.	0
1003344	It makes our bond thicker.	0
1003345	There are many reasons to ban smoking for not only non-smokers, also smokers.	0
1003346	At first, I was very tired and my math grades didn't increase.	0
1003347	Nowadays, Internet becomes the fundamental part of daily life.	0
1003348	First of all, the right and dignity of every single student are important.	0
1003349	This decision is right.	0
1003350	If moderate physical punishment is allowed in schools, the students will have more fabulous shool lives and there will be no disturbance in teachers' right.	0
1003351	But these day, many students don't obey their teacher and parents.	0
1003352	So I really scared him when he was alive.	0
1003353	So,I think people have to use their real names to settle the clean Web enviroment.	0
1003354	It is because of my experience.	0
1003355	I got along with him when I was President of student council.	0
1003356	I agree with the physical punishment.	0
1003357	and a birth and death is only problems for human not animals.	0
1003358	It is not effective both teachers and students.	0
1003359	So smoking should be banned in all kind of public building which a number of people use.	0
1003360	Furthermore, if some people use bad words on the Internet, police can catch them easily.	0
1003361	Children on schools forgot soon why teacher upset to student when without physical punishment.	0
1003362	I can see the stars just like the picture from the skymap in school books.	0
1003363	"It's so funny, nowdays without physical punishment we can control rude students.	0
1003364	The experiment is that inject medical materials to the lives such as monkeys, pigs, rats and observe them.	0
1003365	and the math is my only subject that study with music without other thought.	0
1003366	So my family often go to visit ancestors, especially New years day and Thanks giving.	0
1003367	So it is fair that we use animal in medical experiments.	0
1003368	I like the point of physics analyzing the movement of real object.	0
1003369	I think best teacher is teacher who don't give up his students.	0
1003370	As I have lived in Busan, one fo Korea's city, I really want to see such things.	0
1003371	It is memorable experience to me.	0
1003372	Since there are thousands of things to consider as a driver, how can you chat and talk with your friend on the phone!	0
1003373	but that opinion is not considering our special occasion.	0
1003374	But, if there are too frequent and hard physical punishment, it must be changed.	0
1003375	the almost student who hit by their teacher live normally.	0
1003376	First of all, I think that teachers are not just teaching people.	0
1003377	Then can the hand-free gadget of cell phone protect drivers from accidents?	0
1003378	So I went to school once in two weeks.	0
1003379	But problem is that there are no-love their students.	0
1003380	It is helpful to every aspect of their life.	0
1003381	because music is beutiful.	0
1003382	It means Korean men also recognize that military service is duty.	0
1003383	First of all, I heard that English are very kind.	0
1003384	When the situation like this break out, some people feel it is very serious matter, but it is just that time.	0
1003385	So school should find another way for punishment.	0
1003386	So all people are protected by nation's rules and laws.	0
1003387	punishment makes another punishment.	0
1003388	also they make drivers danger.	0
1003389	What we can do to our future-worker is to bring them to a bright side.	0
1003390	I am not arguing that the freedom has no value.	0
1003391	the purpose for that frame was to memorize our family's travel to jeju island.	0
1003392	When I go to witness club, I exercise to use various tool in there.	0
1003393	Therefore, though many smokers insist that smoking is their own rights, more important thing is to protect others' rights.	0
1003394	But that is not the end.	0
1003395	It was kind of an farewell party for us.	0
1003396	My opinion is that some physical punishment should be allowed in schools.	0
1003397	So, I think all public buliding have a smoking zone for smokers.	0
1003398	Those devices blocks sound from outside well-it's good when you listen music, however driving situation is different.	0
1003399	Using cellular phone while driving also have non-human-related problem.	0
1003400	The most important thing is that education about the 'netiquet' have to be done to the students.	0
1003401	however this phenemenon is one of the parents overloving.	0
1003402	Second, if people must use their real name on the internet, maybe cyber criminals can decrese or dissapear.	0
1003403	My family's most special thing is iPhone.	0
1003404	She likes cartoon and playing a computer games.	0
1003405	It is very terrible thing!!	0
1003406	Also, there are some kind of laws for handling animals in experiments.	0
1003407	Those students act very rudely and often say bad words to their friends and even to their teachers.	0
1003408	So I want to go to USA.	0
1003409	So I helped him.	0
1003410	But we should make it clear that these two behaviors are different from eating meat.	0
1003411	We are high school friend.	0
1003412	If smoker do smoke in public buildings where many people use, many people can feel hated to him and the public buildings that permit smoker can smoke.	0
1003413	Although some people contend that using real name on the Internet has many side-effects, using real name on the Internet is very siginificant.	0
1003414	First of all, I seriously agree with physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1003415	cyber world and offline world is too world.	0
1003416	When I was 15 years old, I was suprised at my teacher's weird way of punishment.	0
1003417	It means that there are no substitution for human without animals.	0
1003418	If they are not punished when they make a fault once, they may think the fault which they made is not a serious problem.	0
1003419	Because, this is not an effective way to control students for school teachers.	0
1003420	if they are alone or with the smokers, it is not that bad.	0
1003421	So I don't him forever.	0
1003422	To protect someone who are criticized by other persons by no reason or who are stolen their name or ID, we must use our real name on the Internet.	0
1003423	He is very easy to meet.	0
1003424	But I think that this is a course of men.	0
1003425	And he was very interested in sports, he was good at most sports.	0
1003426	In that days, an individual's point of view is created.	0
1003427	And my yonger brother goes to school and academy everyday.	0
1003428	Also, if they get punishment from teachers, they will make trouble more and more instead of agonizing to change their behaviors that made problem.	0
1003429	Because of that , at first, teachers give punish to children make them study well but finally, the punish was bad solution to children.	0
1003430	To me, studying law was a step to be closer to my own dream.	0
1003431	Still, there needs to be a solution.	0
1003432	I think that the user must use their real name on the Internet in several reasons.	0
1003433	While i usually busy, there are a lot of times on Saturdays.	0
1003434	Secondly, people use shopping malls for multiple purposes and many kinds of choices.	0
1003435	Thesedays, I think because there are many environment that people come with together, to respect other right is imperative.	0
1003436	That mean Korea is not peaceful.	0
1003437	But he isn't angry.	0
1003438	Although they are not traditional, many mixed colors of songs attract me.	0
1003439	They even hate the teachers.	0
1003440	Their efforts are able to save life of millions of people all over the country.	0
1003441	Whenever you can meet the vicious accidents.	0
1003442	For example, we write bad reple that people who have power on the Internet using ID.	0
1003443	And physics is very closed with my dream.	0
1003444	So I agree with the physical punishment of children in school.	0
1003445	One of the best interresting thigs that happened to my past vacation is that I could make a new girlfriend.	0
1003446	Of course it will be the best way to use human body in the medical experiments.	0
1003447	Due to these reasons I liked Art class the most.	0
1003448	So without the compulsory rule, our country is also to do very well.	0
1003449	My faveraite thing in this vacation is that I have nothing to do in this time.	0
1003450	So it hasn't any good effect to prevent from unrealistic information.	0
1003451	My favorate subject was mathmatics.	0
1003452	My favorite teacher in high school was Kim Kyu Ik teacher.	0
1003453	We played games and had a barbeque party.	0
1003454	Maybe we can lose these things.	0
1003455	If someone is oppressed by phiscal punishment, who are going to love their doing in school?	0
1003456	That is really weird.	0
1003457	If teachers do physical punishment, students will be angry at them and teachers will also feel bad.	0
1003458	In this place I smell the sea and see fish in the nature.	0
1003459	Till, I don't know that, but I know someday I will realize it.	0
1003460	When it comes to the problems of driver's using cellular phones while driving, I believe it should be banned.	0
1003461	For instance, in the situation that you drive and meet a little boy walking ahead the car.	0
1003462	But writing about what they do and know why it is bad, or giving some disadvantage of their report card(which are some 'peaceful' ways) cannot change the bad children's attitudes.	0
1003463	Look at our fathers.	0
1003464	If smoking in public buildings were allowed, none smokers should endure secondhand smoking.	0
1003465	Moreover, I studied German with him for 3 successive years.	0
1003466	He got injured during his military service and showed me the scar.	0
1003467	Physical punishment makes the student hate the lecture.	0
1003468	Because animals' life is samely important as human's life and there are many ways not using animals in experiments.	0
1003469	Korea government say that all Koreans have resposibility to complete military service but for men who has a physical or mental problem there is a progam for other service.	0
1003470	Sometimes people are asked for money from those who pretend as friends.	0
1003471	Although those drivers are very skilled person, they are not good at driving.	0
1003472	When night, I go to the pc-room.	0
1003473	I have a special watch.	0
1003474	Students know that teachers can't punish them physically.	0
1003475	He like games, soccer, basketballs, shopping and so on.	0
1003476	The first singer I found is 'Brocoli, You too'.	0
1003477	Using cellular phones while driving should be banned by a policy of goverment.	0
1003478	Because of that, not only can I remain good shape and also can I have strong bonds with my fellows.	0
1003479	And he was very funny.	0
1003480	If trained with physical force, they will only get the wrong impression that violence is the key to solving problems.	0
1003481	Therefore, when I can get proper lecture of this subject, I was so pleasant to get my historical information finished.	0
1003482	I also have been thinking about it as a highschool student and I support the idea that physical punishment should be allowed in all schools.	0
1003483	Next day, Mr.	0
1003484	Because these are very old and came from my grandparents.	0
1003485	If the physically punishing was acceptable, he would not had behaved like that because the teacher could have hit him.	0
1003486	We had really fun and interesting time at bar that night.	0
1003487	When teachers teach the students, physical punishment can be the efficent tool of teaching.	0
1003488	Our family have moved many times for many reasons.	0
1003489	He was our father.	0
1003490	It also mean she can understand everything related to me.	0
1003491	There are also good cases made by physical punishment.	0
1003492	in the same time men need to got compensation for it.	0
1003493	No more selfishness and no more smoke!	0
1003494	And this substances dirt building's bottom.	0
1003495	So this time is very valuable.	0
1003496	And ban the physical punishment is one way to help this.	0
1003497	No, i think physical punishment should be allowed.	0
1003498	humans should live first.	0
1003499	Fortunatelly, My mother and the other cars driver didn't very heart.	0
1003500	The one that I found is teaching elementary school students in academy When I visited the academy first, the manager asked some questions about me.	0
1003501	I started to studing math very hard and made very high math score.	0
1003502	we will be controlled by impact of person who have a social power and company who make many advertisement, not knowing the exact reality.	0
1003503	Because physical punishment is not for chlidren.	0
1003504	But it didn't.	0
1003505	Some student used other people's name which are someone's friend, even some teacher's name.	0
1003506	I woluld like to go to nation which has a both of Eastern and Western culture.	0
1003507	I think that we needs physical punishment.	0
1003508	My father and my mother were very poor when they were get married.	0
1003509	Before remodeling I did not like my home.	0
1003510	Third, I want to be somewhere very warm and Austrailia is.	0
1003511	All men would be enough for the safety of Korea.	0
1003512	So they have to consider their fault and correct it by themselves.	0
1003513	Also, animal is very similar with human.	0
1003514	so, It is the reason I like him that He is good at some things that I am not.	0
1003515	Because no one is responsible on specific incidents and billions of comments and texts, anybody criticize and cheat and lies on the internet!	0
1003516	And very smart so he was entering Yonsei unversity and recommended me to enter the same university and I'm here.	0
1003517	Furthermore, it has been the one of the 4 civilations.	0
1003518	And when we are sad or gloomy, he always be there for us.	0
1003519	Surely peace should be protected.	0
1003520	Second, I think that teachers need to have probability to physical punishment.	0
1003521	That is the difference in other my freinds.	0
1003522	She understands me better than any other person.	0
1003523	Therefore, I liked to study Japanese word and sentences.	0
1003524	Many teachers concentrate the effect of student's falut.	0
1003525	Because of the driver's irresponsibility for the safety, I was very uncomfortable and worried about an accident that could have occurred.	0
1003526	If I have chance to go abroad, ofcourse I will go to America.	0
1003527	People will write on web more carefully because they will afraid to be a target.	0
1003528	Freedom can't be the whole answer of this problem.	0
1003529	Korea is democracy.	0
1003530	But who knows?	0
1003531	Public buildings are made for public and people have right to use them with no complain.	0
1003532	In real world, we are act according to the people's thinking.	0
1003533	When I'm sad, they cry instead of me and when I'm hard, they help me a lot.	0
1003534	When I was thirteen years old, my family gone to east side sea for summer vacation.	0
1003535	We had such a great time there.	0
1003536	Thanks for my will to get a good grade in math, I could get a 100 score in math in second grade.	0
1003537	By using a real behave list like this, children can understand how good or bad they are now.	0
1003538	So, I think it should prohibit using cellular phone only with hand while driving.	0
1003539	This days, our society become busy more and more.	0
1003540	I can say punishment system of my high school is much more better than that of middle school.	0
1003541	Ofcourse It is limited by social opinion.	0
1003542	So, smoking in the public or closed building is crime which give damage to other people.	0
1003543	Therefore, the power of military will be more increased and strong.	0
1003544	After that ceremony I can comfort my mind and I can do my best much more.	0
1003545	I think in this rule, there is no exceptions.	0
1003546	As long as we have a right that we choice our lives, they should have rights that they choose their lives.	0
1003547	For example, the drinkings also harm others.	0
1003548	Almost every drug which have been proved to be safe had been going through this process.	0
1003549	he is really funny and bright so when i was with him, i really happy.	0
1003550	So our members and other clubs' members wanted to play korean music together, and we played korean music for voluntary.	0
1003551	It is possible for smokers to argue that their rights to do what they want are violated if the smoking is prohibited in all public places.	0
1003552	Although I lie and behave different from what I say, I try to behave what is right.	0
1003553	My mother has the ring which is very important to her and my family.	0
1003554	I have travled Europe when I was elementary school 5, and it was really fantastic experience.	0
1003555	For example you are driving now that time your friend call to you.	0
1003556	The most interesting past of this travel is looking around the colleages.	0
1003557	Kim.	0
1003558	For example, the point of punishment way is not only persasive, and also deprive of students' right to study through ban to going school.	0
1003559	Because of surveyers' uncareful deed in experiment, many animals can get the questionable disease or even die.	0
1003560	because they are men.	0
1003561	Therefore, I want to go Austrailia first, if I have a chance to travel.	0
1003562	in short, It is important to prevent bad events result from using non-real name in internet but that is a work giving to official.	0
1003563	And I know that our country are lack of our own military so we need to enlarge the number of military.	0
1003564	Every Saturday since i was born, all my family members have a rest at home.	0
1003565	For exempla, Osaka castle, Tongchungak, Universal studio in japan(USJ) and so on.	0
1003566	I'm often angry with very little things that she does.	0
1003567	Her name is Min Kyoung Chon.	0
1003568	first,use one hand to use cellular phone to watch, and then another hand use driving.	0
1003569	But, nowadays, people think that most important thing in world and informations ages is each person's pesonallity.	0
1003570	But I insist that there are no other more important things than safe.	0
1003571	We can watch the news about such deceit.	0
1003572	In that case, It is one who is calling that kill that people.	0
1003573	Surely, it has probability to be a means of violence.	0
1003574	But I think we are not in the war.	0
1003575	As a result, i think physical punishment should be allowed.	0
1003576	At present military service term is about two years.	0
1003577	for example, Louvre Museum, Effel tower, and Mont- marte's paintors.	0
1003578	The other personality is that the mind for others.	0
1003579	Second, punishment is one of the most effective ways to eradicate disorders in a class.	0
1003580	After being changed it, the relationship between the teacher and student will become better.	0
1003581	but, as deserts have oasis, there is a oasis in my home.	0
1003582	My parents bought it when we visited the teddy bear museum in Jeju island.	0
1003583	My father have been smoke since he was in my age.	0
1003584	I like Music.	0
1003585	But she has a constant connection with me, and gave me university informations, and when i need documents about university, she provided that things.	0
1003586	I have many friends who just got stop smoking because its uncomfortability to smoke outside.	0
1003587	The person under pressure can't tell other people about his/her situation through the in internet because government could know the exact person because his/her real name is posted online.	0
1003588	By doing this little thing, "using real name", we can make the online world healthier and happier.	0
1003589	I like read books about economics, biology, psychology.	0
1003590	After that experiences, I thought that this special ring is my lucky item.	0
1003591	Although the developed countries have already prohibited the punishment with physical punishment, their students have good personalities and done many achievements.	0
1003592	Its phychological impact is serious too.	0
1003593	I do agree with the opinion that drivers of automobiles should not be allowed to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1003594	It is Japan.	0
1003595	I think Korean men shouldn't be forced to make it.	0
1003596	For these reasons, I want to go USA.	0
1003597	I do the part time job at the wedding hall, spending 13 hours.	0
1003598	So they want to be different person in Internet.	0
1003599	We are very happy.	0
1003600	It is undeniable that the enormous amount of tax which smokers pay annually is now taking important part in government budget.	0
1003601	But if people use their real name, they will be more careful when they upload about something.	0
1003602	For example, I went to Paris with my family 3 years ago.	0
1003603	First, there are very less nation that forces military service to men in the world.	0
1003604	i like a lot of sports.	0
1003605	First in aspect of right to be free, non-smokers have right to no smoking.	0
1003606	Because of this, some celebrites suicided.	0
1003607	So the possibility of car accident is getting higher.	0
1003608	But some people disagree to use animals in medical experiments.	0
1003609	Therefore, I believe that people should use their real name when they want to share their opinion on the Internet.	0
1003610	Korea is devidened in two states.	0
1003611	In that time, people was horrified because death of ten percent made the price of pig skyrocketing.	0
1003612	The family picture in our house's living room has very special meaning for me.	0
1003613	These days I have piano lesson in saturday morning.	0
1003614	His major subject was society.	0
1003615	And men also think that save our nation themselves.	0
1003616	We are interesting with same thing.	0
1003617	expecally memorised event is finding a room to sleep.	0
1003618	On Saturdays, I choose some good movies based on other people's opinions.	0
1003619	Responsibility is learned when children are given to the proper punishment.	0
1003620	I think that a word's original meaning can show the answer of that topic.	0
1003621	If the real name, which is one of the important part of private information is known to cyber criminals, it will make them much easier to commit crimes.	0
1003622	So I cannot agree with the physical punishmnet in schools.	0
1003623	And smoking-banning public buildings would help them a lot.	0
1003624	But to non-smokers, it is hard to filter them.	0
1003625	Anyway, I really thinks it a real precious treasure and really really like it of course.	0
1003626	Because of their status, we have to focus what we do.	0
1003627	How can we know about effects medicines have?	0
1003628	If smoking in the building is banned, smokers will have to go outside to smoke or smokers who do not want to go outside will not smoke at the moment, especially in the cold whether.	0
1003629	To develope robots which can instead animals is the most good way that we can do, but until succeding to make robots, animals can't help avoiding their destiny.	0
1003630	I think using animals in medical experiments is wrong.	0
1003631	Many doctors and scientists, however, studied with animals and found many solution to cure many severe diseases.	0
1003632	I do my best doing this work, and plus confident my walking.	0
1003633	When we back to the society, We can't do the thing which we can before.	0
1003634	Consequently, for every human being animal use in medical wxperiments is inevitable.	0
1003635	Using cellular phone while driving is a multi-tasking, too.	0
1003636	There are some reasons for this.	0
1003637	Also the people who has their own reason to reject military service such as religous or physical reason should be respected not distinguish from others.	0
1003638	But I don't mean military service is not good.	0
1003639	If Sangmu wan not exsist, all sport players should serve his best two years in army and go downhill during his rest carrer, Nor 2010 miracle.	0
1003640	I want to learn British accent and U.K's landscape is really peaceful.	0
1003641	Ji Sung Park is my dream.	0
1003642	And T-express is best attraction in Korea.	0
1003643	I think it is more difficult than that they can use two hands.	0
1003644	Finally, If the smoking is not be banned in all public bulidings, the public policy make smokers more and more.	0
1003645	And I think that instead of forcing him to go military, forcing him to do good things to Korea he can do better is the better dicide.	0
1003646	Some people might still disagree with me.	0
1003647	First of all, it can reduce fight on the internet.	0
1003648	In dinner time, i go to restaurant with my hall family and we enjoy a great meal.	0
1003649	Today's many worlds rules about economy is from UK's rules.	0
1003650	One of reasons of this is that children can see people smoking in public buildings like museums, public offices.	0
1003651	If I had a chance to travel abroad, the first country I would like to visit is England.	0
1003652	People can use nickname usually but when people do limited things, administrator can use real name of that people to arrest.	0
1003653	And my opinion is greatly substantiated by the reasons below.	0
1003654	For example, there are small mouse, monkey, and so on.	0
1003655	When you get hit by others, you will surely feel that you are just like some boxes out there.	0
1003656	l'm agree this question , because real name is clean the internet	0
1003657	First, to make the best studying environment, school teachers need to control students properly.	0
1003658	But that's the points that I like them.	0
1003659	No, I don't agree with the physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1003660	That is happy of me and my family.	0
1003661	There are many arguments about using real name on the Internet.	0
1003662	But that is really bad thoughts.	0
1003663	This way is a truly bad education I think.	0
1003664	And, we did so many other games together.	0
1003665	If we could not do animal experience in medical field, we might have catastrophy such as serious complication and human loss.	0
1003666	And 'Teacher and student' relationship was one of the 'up or down' relationships.	0
1003667	I think that drivers of automobiles should be banned in using cellular phones while driving.	0
1003668	When children are young, most of them are kind and listen to their teacher's words well.	0
1003669	I think because teachers are kind of busy, have lots of things to do, and children keep annoying them, so teachers take the easiest way to have children's mouth shut.	0
1003670	but he will go on soccer in the MU.	0
1003671	And also, it means a lot to me because one of my best friend works for the rights of animals.	0
1003672	Multitasking decreases our brain, so it takes more time to resolve the task.	0
1003673	By using the real name make people take more responsibility of their words and it would not undermine the right of expression.	0
1003674	But the next day I felt hurt all my body.	0
1003675	For example, she know well abouy my family story, my concern, my character and my mood.	0
1003676	I agree with that smoking should be banned in all public buildings.	0
1003677	But if that action is against in other's right, there is no need to justify that action.	0
1003678	But, they can even get hurt in physically and emotionally.	0
1003679	in the game, i met many people.	0
1003680	We are thinking animal.	0
1003681	YES, I think forcing to go to the army is needed.	0
1003682	We should think practically and have hard mind.	0
1003683	In these reasons, I think it is appropriate to allow physical punishment in schools.	0
1003684	In fact, I was only able to put it on back when the concert was over.	0
1003685	If that rules are declared, people will be careful in their writings and the bad rumors will decrease.	0
1003686	so they remain almost same numbers compared to past time.	0
1003687	especially, peolpe who work at a public institution are to lead a this atmsphere.	0
1003688	But there is no man who can do that.	0
1003689	But many parents and students think that phisical punishment in school is problem however in privet aducation is not bad.	0
1003690	In this situation the nation have to consider their such hard situations.	0
1003691	They talk bad in front of instructors.	0
1003692	Also I could see that there were no thrown-away cigarettes on the floor, which made the place a lot cleaner.	0
1003693	First, Internet should be a place of freedom.	0
1003694	How can they concentrate on driving while saying something and listening to somebody on the phone?	0
1003695	Rain got to pour.	0
1003696	I can't agree with animal experiments.	0
1003697	But Work time end I feel happy.	0
1003698	Drivers should think that distracting his or her attention from driving could kill some other innocent people and even him or herself.	0
1003699	So by visiting Europe, I can feel the history on feet.	0
1003700	i can also know it's danger reasonally.	0
1003701	They just understand the thing that teachers don't hit them.	0
1003702	But do they have enough effects than a little punishmet?	0
1003703	In military force, most of men become simple, ordinary, and the same regardless of his talent, aptitude.	0
1003704	The most reason why I like her is the advising about my problem.	0
1003705	I really wantted they have to go rightway.	0
1003706	But the reality that powerful person don't have to go to the army is not matched for this.	0
1003707	So I believe it's possible to stop using animals.	0
1003708	real name polite will started widely.	0
1003709	And it can stimulate the men's curiousity about what he wants to do.	0
1003710	my favorite teacher in my high school is sunhee Lee. she is a math teacher Fisrst reason is that my favorite subject is math.	0
1003711	Men who are university students lose this important times and have tough times returning to university to continue their works.	0
1003712	I want to know what made them to be the most powerful country.	0
1003713	if without physial punishment, teacher can not quite student and they study time reduce more.	0
1003714	After that, it will be okay to use physical punishment in schools.	0
1003715	Therefore, this precious family album just includes our family's small history.	0
1003716	Then, how could humans heal or cure them?	0
1003717	It might be even ok in making pills such as painkillers.	0
1003718	Because it doesn't have any effect with students.	0
1003719	So there are no differencies between human beings and animals that have used in medical experiments in terms of the same life- beings on earth.	0
1003720	I was really sad so cried.	0
1003721	Second, in curve road, they can't curve their car, so the car can go out in the road, so they can get damages, extremely if they fall in a valley, their life could be really dangerous.	0
1003722	We must not make a mistake like past.	0
1003723	This is similar to the academic fields.	0
1003724	It's also same to animals.	0
1003725	so people don't speak ill of other people in unexperienced reasons.	0
1003726	Also the class was consist of our own presentations, so we can participate more actively.	0
1003727	she is my teacher, my mento and my second mother.	0
1003728	So we give bad score to students who aren't abide from school's regulation.	0
1003729	Because we spend time together for long time, we know well about each other and it is really good thing.	0
1003730	To tell the truth, government safe the drivers life to made that policy.	0
1003731	I think that smoking is really harmful in smoker's health and even other people.	0
1003732	But human's memory is not that good.	0
1003733	He can sit in one place and listen to what I'm saying for over an hour.	0
1003734	I have an experience about it.	0
1003735	So, physical punishment in schools must be out of education system.	0
1003736	Then I became familiar with English.	0
1003737	More strong, and effective Nettiquet Education is needed.	0
1003738	And 2 years is very long term.	0
1003739	I remember so beautiful sea of tongyoung.	0
1003740	So I think there is another good way rather than banning smoking in all public buildings by law.	0
1003741	All people who were alive at that time say it was dreadful.	0
1003742	I think that people must use their real name on the internet.	0
1003743	Suprisingly, then the problem is easier and i can solve the problem.	0
1003744	There is also a second solution for this problem and it is to make particular smoking area in building.	0
1003745	but Nobody like being subjects.	0
1003746	I don't agree with using real name on the internet It is Free that is important in the internet.	0
1003747	Most af all, they can gain their own health, stabillity of phycology and peaceful of mind.	0
1003748	the dinner.	0
1003749	Then he always explaind about that problem.	0
1003750	However this opinions can't be accepted.	0
1003751	I don't agree that smoking should be banned in all public buildings because smoking people have their own rights and we need to consider those.	0
1003752	In the long respect, it is more effective.	0
1003753	Second, even though they use both hands to drive by hand free machine, they should not use phones, because it distracts drivers not to focus on driving.	0
1003754	There are some vital reasons supporting my argument.	0
1003755	Of course, car driving while using cellphones is also bad for pedestrians.	0
1003756	if car accidents happend, both drivers and pedestrians are dangered.	0
1003757	I live in Mokpo, but I have friends in different area in korea.	0
1003758	This fact proves that we have no reason that all korean men should be forced to complete military service.	0
1003759	Also, students and teachers can be awared of the level of punishment, as there are limits to students physical ability.	0
1003760	To solve this problem Internet users need to realize they also have to be responsible for what they say(or write, literally) on the Internet just as in real life.	0
1003761	Second, the physical punishment is not the best way to teach children.	0
1003762	So when they come out to the social life, they can be more sociable and live powerful life.	0
1003763	Then, why humans use animals in medical experiments for human?	0
1003764	The subject which I like best is Korean.	0
1003765	so many of the governments and other enviroments people are should be effort.	0
1003766	I think this problem will also be discouraged by using real name in the internet.	0
1003767	First, the U.	0
1003768	In addition, the risk of fire will increases if smoking in public buildings is allowed.	0
1003769	Maybe smokers will say they have a right to do what they want.	0
1003770	fighting accidents become doubled and because they anymore don't afraid teachers many students are never listen to lecture and even speak louldly in class but friends's mom can do nothing.	0
1003771	Of course I know that today has many car accidents caused by using the cellular phones while driving.	0
1003772	But now they are very powerful.	0
1003773	Through playing game with friends, Friends and me got friendship.	0
1003774	I like to go out and be in the charity.	0
1003775	That's not odd.	0
1003776	In movie, main character is very strong and clever.	0
1003777	On Saturday morning, I usually go hiking with my parents becuase there is a mountain back in my apartment.	0
1003778	Therefore I could make many friends.	0
1003779	we saw many things but the most interesting thing is china town where many chinesse lives.	0
1003780	If there are not animal experiments how we can get medical benefit?	0
1003781	So this point should also be considered.	0
1003782	Second, punished children can have mentally distressed.	0
1003783	So they are confused identity caused by virtual name much using.	0
1003784	When I learned digest, heart and so on, it was so surprised that I was caught by biology.	0
1003785	The qualities that my best friend have are kindness and competency in her area.	0
1003786	And Last, because I liked it, I got a good testing score.	0
1003787	if the students don't take rule again and again the school give the students physical punishment.	0
1003788	But It is necessary?	0
1003789	another thing i usually do is playing soccer at 5 pm in nearby high school playground after playing computer game.	0
1003790	That time, my family are very sad.	0
1003791	Although now we kill some animals for experiments, we can save much more animals in the future.	0
1003792	My best friend has a very nice face so I sometimes envy him so much.	0
1003793	First of all, if teachers could not punish students physically, they may be very difficult to control students.	0
1003794	I have several reasons why I want to go there.	0
1003795	After that, I go to sleep.	0
1003796	After he finds himself something wrong, he tries to keep it in his mind and not to do such thing again.	0
1003797	When children grow up with violences done by teachers, they could understand violence is the easiest way to make another person do what they want.	0
1003798	That smell is very tired and irritated when non-smoker smell that.	0
1003799	First of all, students do not want physical punishment, so they follow the rules of school.	0
1003800	The really good thing is that the students should not do actions which evoke some physical punishments.	0
1003801	To sum up, I strongly believe that animals to be used in medical experiments because the result of having medical experiments is useful to people.	0
1003802	So millitary service can be the good chance of advancing for their health.	0
1003803	Third, voluntary education system is much better than physical punishment.	0
1003804	I had studied hard in middleschool, so my test grade was still good.	0
1003805	If someone smokes in public building, many people will be exposed to harmful substances, and it will be a critical effect on the health of many people.	0
1003806	His class was very interesting to us.	0
1003807	Instead, change forced military service to volunteerly and benefit the people who complete military service somewhat another way.	0
1003808	Finally, when drivers of automobiles ar allowed to use cellular phones while driving, it makes other acitivies while driving.	0
1003809	Yes. For medical advance, animal experiments are needed.	0
1003810	I think that people must use their real name on the internet.	0
1003811	For the smokers, to stop smoking is better than to look for smoking zone.	0
1003812	If I have a chance to travel, I want to go to the England.	0
1003813	It is largerly agreed that comfortable places like house rather interrupt rythm of reading.	0
1003814	and if we had some time, we often go to the restorant that my friend's mom operated.	0
1003815	triagle symbolize friendship, love, and forever.	0
1003816	When teachers take physical punishment, they should consider effects of physical punishment.	0
1003817	So I love his philosophy.	0
1003818	Because animals are same with human.	0
1003819	There are many cool and nice clothes.	0
1003820	in past, children should be respect adults and submissive.	0
1003821	Smokers should respect other people's health, and they must not smoke in public areas.	0
1003822	Yes. I think smoking should be banned in all public buildings.	0
1003823	But someone who has their own problem does not need to be forced to complete military service.	0
1003824	Also, he was very humorous.	0
1003825	For example, students might not listen to the lecture or ignore what teacher says.	0
1003826	My best friend crossed all the lines to be a friend with me.	0
1003827	I could have great high school season because he was always with me.	0
1003828	We do this things for our cosmetics, drugs etc.	0
1003829	Moreover, there are more influential teaching method that many books and media recommend.	0
1003830	It showed us 'physical punishments' is the most effective way to teach.	0
1003831	I want to see kangaroo and koalra in Austrailia.	0
1003832	However, cell phone should not be allowed while driving, because it can occur serious accidents by distracting drivers and hurting them.	0
1003833	If people use their real names on the internet, Information about a person would be easily exposed to other person, because one's real name makes it available to search about that name on the websites and gather information about that person.	0
1003834	then my best friend named Hanul take my broken cube.	0
1003835	So many people inhale the air, and their healthy goes bad especially pragnant.	0
1003836	Although they were the old age's people, they had similar days to us and wrote the poetry.	0
1003837	Like this reason , using cellular phone should be not allowed.	0
1003838	We met in the middle school.	0
1003839	However, there are a lot of cases that the nonphysical punishments were so effective to teach children in schools.	0
1003840	The point is children should be taught by a conversation and careful look.	0
1003841	In this reason I like History subject the most.	0
1003842	Someone say that it is free to use cell phones while driving.	0
1003843	From my point of view, physical punishment of children in schools poses negative effects on children development.	0
1003844	In this way, the student learns easily why he or she got the points and takes them.	0
1003845	we met foriener tourists in accident, they asked to us how to get beach.	0
1003846	We need to change position with animals, if we change our position with animals we can never use animals in medicals experiments, because we can feel animals feelings.	0
1003847	may be we build more green belt for them and for us.	0
1003848	For instance, if a teacher physically punish students too many times, students can have a bad feeling about that teacher.	0
1003849	However, and even though I, too, am a student, I think differently and I feel confident of my statement.	0
1003850	But most of teachers have studied in the right curriculum so they can control the situation in properly.	0
1003851	Otherwise, their careless actions can cause other people to suffer, or even to lose their lives.	0
1003852	But It's very hard things to all people.	0
1003853	Because just advice can't correct their think, persnality.	0
1003854	It is not only good for their health, but also good for other people's health.	0
1003855	They aren't perfect people but they live longer, think deeper, and know wider than children.	0
1003856	However, because animal has their own rights, we have to do everything we can for animal right.	0
1003857	That's why everyone should be aware of the fact and always be cautious in everything.	0
1003858	My favorite teacher is Korean teacher when i was third grade.	0
1003859	Also, It is not the only problem of driver himself.	0
1003860	Without that, we might spend a lot of money to know the real effect of that medicine because some chemical things make new effects we did not expect.	0
1003861	But now it is making another problems mostly because people don't use their real name.	0
1003862	Thinking of Yeonpyeongdo accident, it is true that stronger military makes safer country.	0
1003863	My friend's school also has rule.	0
1003864	There are many opinions about military service.	0
1003865	They tend to commit these crimes to make other people's reputation fall down in their societies.	0
1003866	That year Japanese students came to Korea and lived in Korean students' house.	0
1003867	In addition, Choongmoo kimbab can be a delicious food in the night.	0
1003868	So I think people must use their real name on the Internet and merits of using real name are like below.	0
1003869	these are exist since far past.	0
1003870	And we talked for a while.	0
1003871	Lot's of weak animals or hurted animals are protected by us.	0
1003872	Sometimes, people can't adapt the military social and they escape the arm.	0
1003873	I liked him because of several reasons.	0
1003874	To my memory i always walk like cat to make no sound and if i make loud sound, i fear that moment that's maybe i feel all my behavior was like a gilt their was no punishment at make loud sound but as a child that was just fear thing and that was cured at 17 as a high school student to see it now, i could conclude one that is physical punishment make child sick at mind and that could make body weak, too so i am very sad now because i have reaitively less pride than other guys yes, past effect my life and this is very bad thing to all children punishment could make parents comfortable as 'i swiched my child' but, to my think that's not it make worse their child's behavior and mind they should take other way with no pain	0
1003875	Drug developers are also human however they are skillful, so there must be a mistake when they make drugs.	0
1003876	I will not forget it and next year I will elect.	0
1003877	So their student takes very high study result without physical punishment.	0
1003878	If our children see the smoking person, they want to do that because of curious thinking.	0
1003879	Thirdly, some of children now will be a teacher.	0
1003880	They have the will to quit smoking but they can't actually quit smoking at once.	0
1003881	I had to check so many things before I drive and adjusting the speed while driving was not easy.	0
1003882	Because China is very similar with Korea, it will be easy to get used to chinese environment.	0
1003883	There are many problem on the Internet, because on the Internet, we can not know who really is and even we know people we met at web, we can't do anything to them.	0
1003884	Just I disagree with the abolish of physical punishment.	0
1003885	When we use our real name on the Internet we can not write bad words about another people easily.	0
1003886	but we hardly notice about that.	0
1003887	But many people don't want to reveal their identity and just talk about their opinion.	0
1003888	Also in few years ago, when physical punishment is allowed, students was very rude.	0
1003889	The name is 'Muhandojun' I love this comedy program and after this program I have dinner.	0
1003890	In the contest in school, I usually play the piano and so ma ny people love to listen to it.	0
1003891	Another reason I liked math is that it was the easiest subject for me to explain to friends.	0
1003892	It was one of the very fantastic trips that I have ever traveled.	0
1003893	Animals' weakness can not be the reason that they should be used in medical experiments instead of human.	0
1003894	I like science because I love it very much.	0
1003895	The box always allow me to remember thing that I done.	0
1003896	Physical punishment should be allowed in most of schools.	0
1003897	This means there is always possibility that war can broke out.	0
1003898	If you suffer very hard time over a year and you are isolated a small world so you even can't meat your family, you will feel something.	0
1003899	Taking a same school bus, we begin hanging around well.	0
1003900	Luckilly, he is health.	0
1003901	So when I look the trees and birds at park, I feel fresh.	0
1003902	We often watch it when we eat lunch and dinner.	0
1003903	Also, when men complete the military service, men don't adjust the society of that time well.	0
1003904	Second, after our military force would be weakened, our nation can not help depending on other country or some organizaiton something like U.S.A or UN.	0
1003905	So in those two schools, without physical punishment, teachers just can not control their students.	0
1003906	It is place which placed many human-sized plastic dolls.	0
1003907	I saw the news that the acident by the careless drivers who use cellular phone while driving was increasing.	0
1003908	If the man who have no disorder or problem he should be forced to complete military service.	0
1003909	So i eat out dinner with my parents.	0
1003910	But to save more lives, we have to do experiments with animals.	0
1003911	Saturday is one of my favorite day.	0
1003912	So, they can make mistakes like: smoking or drinking in young ages, stealing, bothering others.	0
1003913	They haven't lied to me and will not.	0
1003914	In newspapers or boardcastings some students ignored their teacher and offend them.	0
1003915	I can't remember even I am my mother's son.	0
1003916	When i caome back, I usally play computer games with my friends in on-line, or watch movies in TV.	0
1003917	No. i don't agree with the physical punishment of chilldren in schools.	0
1003918	) effected me to be little conservative.	0
1003919	My best friend names is song ho lee.	0
1003920	Now I just have 10 Japanese magazines because it is too expensive, but I'll continue to collect more Japanese magazines in the future.	0
1003921	I really want to see Noel, the member of Oasis, in my eyes.	0
1003922	It has a lot of information about entire world.	0
1003923	Also, when I miss my family, I just can call them and listen to their voices.	0
1003924	To be frank with you, I didn't have a specific way about my future.	0
1003925	The cap is a first gift to be given her.	0
1003926	In this situation, without physical punishment, teacher cannot make him stop talking.	0
1003927	But animal experiments should be conducted at last moment after doing all the possible ways.	0
1003928	Up to a point, I disagree with that opinion.	0
1003929	In this reason, i strongly agree with statement that people must use their real name on the internet.	0
1003930	Initially, banning smoking in public buildings is ignoring smokers' rights to smoke in a comfort and cozy place.	0
1003931	My favorite teacher was my homeroom teacher when I was 3rd grade.	0
1003932	and some of this incidents are going on for cellular phones.	0
1003933	But it does not lower the possibility of occuring accidents.	0
1003934	However she suddenly decided to go to German for her dream, an actress.	0
1003935	I belive that physical punishment is not the effective way to teach children in school since school is the place where children learn how to associate with others and how to admit their bad behaviors not just terrifying the punishment.	0
1003936	After weekend, I suffered my arm and leg hurt.	0
1003937	The entire human welfare is undoubtedly the first priority whatsoever.	0
1003938	He always cheered me up whenever I got disappointing exam results, and inspired me with his wise advices.	0
1003939	These are the following reasons.	0
1003940	The reason is that children have some chances that they can disturb class or bully other chilren and without physical punishment, that can't be clearly over from school.	0
1003941	Some people think that drivers of automobiles should not be allowed to use cellular phones while driving but I do not agree with it for several reasons.	0
1003942	so i heard i'm accepted , so happy and even i couldn't believe that for a while.	0
1003943	It supposes that the risk,during driving car, is close to life of driver.	0
1003944	I agree that people must use their real name on the Internet.	0
1003945	Maybe, there are no ones who feel happy after killing lives.	0
1003946	There were many foods and entertainments, so I was able to get rid of all the stress of study for go to university.	0
1003947	almost student think like that.	0
1003948	Teacher should aware about that the physical punishment which overs right degrees is violation.	0
1003949	and her health go bad.	0
1003950	There are very strict rules and relationships in military.	0
1003951	Smoking is very harm to not only smokers, but also other people.	0
1003952	A country I would like to go first is definitely France, paris.	0
1003953	And smoking should be banned in public building because it helps smokers quit smoking.	0
1003954	When they do bad act, school have to correct them.	0
1003955	But It is not the choice, do not using a cellular phone while they drive is must-do thing.	0
1003956	The object that has special meaning for my family is digital camera.	0
1003957	But like many doctors and news say, it's difficult for woman who smokes to have healthy baby.	0
1003958	In this kind of situation, physical punishment can be a solution.	0
1003959	If possible, I want to go to USA first.	0
1003960	Finally, I maintain all Korean men should be forced to complete military service for these reasons, examples.	0
1003961	Therefore, we should find better ways like that to educate children by replacing the physical punishment.	0
1003962	I want to study what we have to accept or not from it.	0
1003963	My favorite teacher in high school was Song hee young.	0
1003964	So many famous companies and interesting stores were there.	0
1003965	I love physics and his lecture was very interesting.	0
1003966	First, Smoking in building is very harmful of people and give disgusting smell or smoke to non-smokers.	0
1003967	And it will much worse for other's health.	0
1003968	People have same rights to use all public buildings.	0
1003969	the man's hand grasp the phone, and other hand grasp the wheel.	0
1003970	However, i should not be allowed this statement.	0
1003971	And this year January 17, the baby are found in the world.	0
1003972	Like a USA if we pay better than now, many korean men could be job soldier.	0
1003973	Next day, we played soccer again and played baseball.	0
1003974	That novel is based in the author's experience.	0
1003975	For example, charging persons smoking in smoking-banned places.	0
1003976	I attended a science high school, and studying in a totally new environment was not easy.	0
1003977	so I think there needs the law of not allowed punishment in schools life.	0
1003978	In short, teacher have to treat them propely method(not physical punishment), after that treatment if their will be no symptom of getting better of their action, teacher had better give physical punishment.	0
1003979	So we don't have any other means.	0
1003980	If we neglect these fact, our family and friend will be exposed in very dangerous circumstances which don't across road safely.	0
1003981	So I like drawing picture very much.	0
1003982	Because if we let teachers do physical punishment, there can happen serious cases like breaking children's legs or arms.	0
1003983	And it makes other people feel shamed.	0
1003984	Because I ate food that my mother made, It is so difficult to make our food.	0
1003985	When we arrived to our hotel, we heard the news about the accident in our going to Gangneung.	0
1003986	It is very dangerous behavior.	0
1003987	These days, there are many news about bad students.	0
1003988	If non-smokers care about their health, they will not be happy if smoking is allowed in the building.	0
1003989	Also, sometimes there are teachers whom use the physical punishment to 'show' their power.	0
1003990	family pictures view various era.	0
1003991	If punishment was not allowed in schools, the students would be very rude and would not study hard.	0
1003992	But.	0
1003993	The 38 line seperates Korea with South Korea and North Korea in the continent.	0
1003994	I got really angry at him for not doing it, but before punishing him I instead told him that I would give him a prize if he completed it.	0
1003995	We should not smash the potential of children by harsh punishment both physical or phycological way.	0
1003996	Also, he was good at teaching.	0
1003997	So he stress on being positive.	0
1003998	We just need powerful weapons and security systems.	0
1003999	The reason makes me agree was that it is necesaary to prevent online violences rumors or bad replies.	0
1004000	And i'm sure that they are right.	0
1004001	There were no other animal to fight with them.	0
1004002	At that time, she was a science teacher.	0
1004003	At first, I thought she may not be able to solve my problems.	0
1004004	The first place I have traveled was Pyeon	0
1004005	Sumanhue have free board.	0
1004006	It is hung on the wall of my parents' bedroom.	0
1004007	Therefore poeple have to depend their country of their own.	0
1004008	But, those sacrifice is to make the better future.	0
1004009	Even though I partly agree with that the physical punishment has some kind of good effects on children, but, in my opinion, it has much more bad effects on them.	0
1004010	N. said that, Our human must have the right of happiness, because that is the innate right.	0
1004011	If you have lake of attention, you can have accidents.	0
1004012	When they chatting in social media they will use real name so they might feel that this is the real world.	0
1004013	So on saturday I usually take a exercise with my friends.	0
1004014	Some people say that this good things can be learned without physical punishment in school.	0
1004015	When I was in the first grade, my family had financial difficulty.	0
1004016	We may be dead because of many disease.	0
1004017	So on Saturdays, I usually meet my friends and do what I wanted to do when I studied for exam.	0
1004018	For instance, Many doctor used mouse to experiment their new medicins.	0
1004019	When I was going through emotional turmoil, she was there for me to hear for me.	0
1004020	It's a big tragedy people, particular many children think that Smoking is a nice thing.	0
1004021	Very important and critical massege can be sent only by celluar phones If the driver is driving.	0
1004022	and..............	0
1004023	First, I realized that what i know is greatly different from what i teach, because I had to explain more elaborately and easily when she didn't know some words or grammatic problems, or listening and reading skills.	0
1004024	Of course I know there are good teachers who treat their students with love, but there are also bad teachers who treat their children with unfair measures.	0
1004025	and i think it's unfair that men have to go to military, whereas women don't.	0
1004026	because automobile distract driver's attention.	0
1004027	Third, there are many people who are shameful about take steps to person.	0
1004028	It is also Korean's ashame to foreigner.	0
1004029	Recently smoking is banned in the TV because it can make young children to imitate them and smoke.	0
1004030	But many of them are very hostile and have rude expression which can harm other people.	0
1004031	But nowadays school teacher's power is so weak.	0
1004032	In that points, smokers disturb others rights.	0
1004033	But If I have a chance to trevel, I will go cambodia.	0
1004034	yes, high school was 3 yeas vrey imfortant.	0
1004035	It is a love.	0
1004036	And i go to las vegas and play bet.	0
1004037	In my teacher's class, he showed a short film to us.	0
1004038	Sometimes, people must visit there to do their works.	0
1004039	And make a another smoking damage.	0
1004040	If we are to use our real names, it will take away the advantage that the Internet users enjoy when being on-line.	0
1004041	First, she listens to others very carefully.	0
1004042	Secondly, my aunt have lived in the England for many years.	0
1004043	Smoking people have to think about other people that do not smoke.	0
1004044	First of all, smoking is harmful for people's health and it also affects the other people next to them.	0
1004045	i agee with the physical punishment.	0
1004046	To begin with, Some people writes rumors or things that not allowed on the Internet.	0
1004047	And they don't study that time But women have 2 years more.	0
1004048	Because I was taught by him, I liked to study chemistry.	0
1004049	First, Using cellular phones makes us disconcentrate on driving.	0
1004050	My mother doesn't like meat but others favorite food is meat, so we usually eat meat.	0
1004051	She was trying to go out car with her head down.	0
1004052	So many classes become noisy.	0
1004053	It's my digital camera.	0
1004054	Korean society is until male-centered because its connection of military and society.	0
1004055	She also teached how to study other subjects.	0
1004056	So when I was late at home, she always call me and tell me to go home early.	0
1004057	My best friend's name is Hwang Hyun-Jin and I like him because of these reasons.	0
1004058	When I got adimitted Yonsei university, she was happy as she is my mother.	0
1004059	Hwang had tried to make stem cells by using animals.	0
1004060	It is the best endeavor that mankind can make for dying animals by experiments.	0
1004061	We must have to develop the nuclear bomb not to military service.	0
1004062	I think It will be better with the time goes.	0
1004063	they make me laugh.	0
1004064	So this situation go on and on, in the test women's test results superb that of men's nowadays.	0
1004065	In modern society, each person's thought should be honored.	0
1004066	So I think physical punishment is the only right for teachers who have to help thier students develop sociability.	0
1004067	So I agree with my parents.	0
1004068	Trust is very important thing for person to person interaction because people need to others trust for opening their mind.	0
1004069	And you should take the resposiblity of what you say.	0
1004070	I have a lot of friends, so I don't know who is my best friend exactly.	0
1004071	And almost their parents didn't punish them.	0
1004072	You would feel very bad when you should do things, not with your will.	0
1004073	Accordingly, I agreed that statement that drivers of automobiles should not be allowed to use celluar phones while driving.	0
1004074	Finally I heard that there are a lot of tour sites, so trip to Japan will be interesting.	0
1004075	The way to resolve is to let them learn neticket and feel in another persons shoes who was attacked by themselves.	0
1004076	If people use their real name, those problems will be solved.	0
1004077	So i helped them with studing for twice a week.	0
1004078	I often meet him these days because we studied together once more to go to fantastic university so we feel like we're family.	0
1004079	There are smoking rooms in each buildings for people who don't smoke and hate the smoking smell and smog.	0
1004080	First, physical punishment is essential for students.	0
1004081	Using real name is a good idea.	0
1004082	So they should be educated in strict ways.	0
1004083	He jokes very well, and has a power that makes other people happy.	0
1004084	Their scientic skill is very wonderful.	0
1004085	It is necessary to make law of physical punishment in school from Ministry of Education.	0
1004086	in case of women, they need not complete military service.	0
1004087	Many entertainer suicided each year.	0
1004088	People do medical experiments to animals because it is dangerous doing medical experiments to a human directly.	0
1004089	Furthermore, think about the car accident that not my fault but the other driver's fault, the driver is taht using the celluar phones while driving.	0
1004090	So I disagree personal things to be showed to people whom I don't know by showing our real name.	0
1004091	Because I had passed the test, my parents finally permitted to go there.	0
1004092	The lastday of 2010 and the first day of 2011 were very interesing	0
1004093	Real name on the Internet is answer.	0
1004094	So I disagree not allowing physical punishment in all schools.	0
1004095	So, I'd like to test my French fluency while traveling.	0
1004096	My best friend is my ex boyfriend.	0
1004097	So I am always happy and excited when we meet.	0
1004098	I had gone to jappan in middle school.	0
1004099	But the one who has the mind of loving the service is better than the ten who think only the finishing time.	0
1004100	So teachers should punish students with real love.	0
1004101	To make a teacher, we should test and test people who want to be a teacher on personality and their ability to love and understand children.	0
1004102	there is no way to stop people's smoking.	0
1004103	He's name is Beung Jun Park.	0
1004104	Also, smoking in public buildings can affect to other's health because indirect smoking is known well as a reason of lung cancer a lot more than direct smoking.	0
1004105	"So, I always try hard to love others.	0
1004106	Since the student is treated in bad way.	0
1004107	Bcause I think the physical punishment is sometimes better than talking student.	0
1004108	We share our feelings and opinions about our members like my sister's wedding.	0
1004109	So many teachers and even some students recollected the past time and said "physical punishment is needed".	0
1004110	Whether it can be justified that animals should be used in medical experimets is now the subject of a lively debate.	0
1004111	For example, they can help old people or orphans.	0
1004112	Some people who argue that physical punishment is essential for student are emphasize that physical punishment lead students to right way.	0
1004113	Here was very durty and smell also too terrible.	0
1004114	Sometimes, I play the games or play the guitar.	0
1004115	Because of her this personality, many people remember her for very long time.	0
1004116	Their always been a lot of car accident every year, though the driver didn't use cellular phones.	0
1004117	The only way that i can remember that is see them in album.	0
1004118	Because they don't exposed to smoking.	0
1004119	Last, South Korean find our military power is not enough rather than the North Korea.	0
1004120	We play sports like soccer or basketball.	0
1004121	Under your own name, you can be more responsible and sincere about what you demand than writting under a random username.	0
1004122	For instance, weak students might not stand with punishment involving hitting with sticks, since they do not have enough powers for that, and teachers can stop punishing students when it seems to be harsh because that is enough punishment for them.	0
1004123	However I can't forget the excitement that I felt whem I throwed the sword to the devil.	0
1004124	If you are inspecting the call while in a hurry you will need cellular phones while driving.	0
1004125	The most interesting thin that happened to me last winter vacation is the graduation.	0
1004126	Besides I heard that around smog is as harmful as three times main smog.	0
1004127	That's all because people could put all sorts of informations on the Internet without any limits.	0
1004128	so before the physical punishment is done, teachers warn their students and behave considerately.	0
1004129	And If they are furinshed strongly, there will be reducing of the accident.	0
1004130	Also, a work processed by cell phone would be not good.	0
1004131	On top of that, people tends to follow punishments rather than incentives.	0
1004132	From these reasons, I want to go to America first.	0
1004133	I think is bad thing smoking in all public building because if one person in the building is smoking other people in building feels very bad and it also not good for our body and it doesn't look good.	0
1004134	There are many reason for that.	0
1004135	But there are ways not to hurt them.	0
1004136	But if really war break out, all of South Korean will fight against our counterpart.	0
1004137	We should not treat them illegally or cruelly.	0
1004138	And, many equipments that replace cellular phones in the car are being made.	0
1004139	Students are young, so they can go emotionally, and make accidents.	0
1004140	The driver drove trucks for about 20 years.	0
1004141	In that point, Egypt is very good place to go.	0
1004142	And I think this should encouraged in any areas like public roads.	0
1004143	but i disagree with them for two reasons.	0
1004144	But some people insist that human is more precious than animal like mouse.	0
1004145	The accidents can not be recovered.	0
1004146	Not really, students, espesially middle school students, who commit a crime has increased.	0
1004147	Do what your minds are telling you to do.	0
1004148	But these can be solved.	0
1004149	Yes, I think smoking shoud be banned in public area.	0
1004150	so people say that internet is anonymous.	0
1004151	If I get the chance to go to China, it will be the great opportunity to practice Chinese.	0
1004152	Teacher who really love his students can get his students though physical punishment with thought his students will be well with this punish ment.	0
1004153	The car entirely broke down.	0
1004154	Second reason why I disagree is the problem of the financial loss.	0
1004155	Assure that one company made a pill which cure the lung cancer.	0
1004156	They don't have rule that hit students, and surely that's not good choice to student's growing.	0
1004157	From time to time I retrospect that time.	0
1004158	the best opinion which I think is if some person unruled the cyber law, the first time he received more taxed, and the second time, only that person must be unclosed his name and everywhere in Internet he always use his real name.	0
1004159	For instance, cyworld users should use their real names on the internet.	0
1004160	The team helps grandparents who live alone.	0
1004161	Experimenting with animals is the best way to insure accuracy of the process.	0
1004162	so I don't have to explain about anything.	0
1004163	But I can work harder after or before military service.	0
1004164	When I didn't go to health club, I watch the tv or play the game, or practice playing the guitar.	0
1004165	So somoking person in public building can make bad image to that building.	0
1004166	Assume that people must use real name.	0
1004167	Sometimes I chat with my friends using my cellphone application "Cacao Talk".	0
1004168	I will tell three reasons why I think smoking should be banned in public buildngs.	0
1004169	That can be a serious ploblem.	0
1004170	so imy feeling is very good.	0
1004171	In spite of the physical punishment is far, there exist a horror in mind.	0
1004172	And for some patients who are suffering from incurable diseases, doctors and scientists do medical experiments.	0
1004173	Fortunately, there was a teacher in my highschool who did all these jobs for us and for me.	0
1004174	We have lots of common things.	0
1004175	I asked him what is that many times, and he gave me a answer.	0
1004176	before i learned basketball, i didn't have excitemant about the sport.	0
1004177	I had a blind date with my friend.	0
1004178	So I enrolled in the driving class right away after the winter vacation started.	0
1004179	So we are too far now to meet everyday.	0
1004180	Allowing physical punishment in school leads to many malfunction.	0
1004181	Yes, it also must not happened.	0
1004182	First of all, military service forcing to young Korean men gets rid of their choices to study.	0
1004183	When I thought I can't enter the university that I really wanted to go, she always said I can do it.	0
1004184	And he is very funny.	0
1004185	So I went to the place where we promissed to meet.	0
1004186	Today, in this modern society, many animals are being used in medical experiments so that researchers could check if a particular medicine is safe for human beings.	0
1004187	Supposed that one heavy smoker may make all of people in same pulic building sick.	0
1004188	But we have to consider smoker's will to smoke.	0
1004189	people is source of power of army.	0
1004190	For my parents, it is object of love and hate.	0
1004191	some elementary student often said sexual joke and even conduct violence.	0
1004192	Past vacation is precious time for me that I can care my health and know about a lot of information of basketball.	0
1004193	In Paris, I was very disappointed and felt disgusting by the scene that people threw away cigarettes on the floor in the public places.	0
1004194	After i read Anne Frank's diary, i also gave my diary a name "Kitty".	0
1004195	These opinions are overlooking something more important.	0
1004196	I agree that people must use their real name on the Internet.	0
1004197	There are some reasons that the role of physical punishment is important.	0
1004198	These kind of changes were interesting.	0
1004199	So I don't agree with Korean military service program.	0
1004200	If I met difficult problem, I prays at rings.	0
1004201	Inspite of moral feelings for that animals, we should investigate for our life.	0
1004202	That's why smoking is now banned on airplanes, trains, and buses.	0
1004203	I think that physical punishment should be executed.	0
1004204	But if the experiments being for humans, maybe the worst.	0
1004205	so There are three big reasons.	0
1004206	Sometimes, students assert their self-esteem.	0
1004207	I think, of course, there are disadvantages of using real name on the Internet.	0
1004208	When punishment become problem, teacher gave too harsh punishment to kid like eight year's old.	0
1004209	Whenever we go back to home from school or work place, she runs out to the front door and greets us.	0
1004210	First, the war between North and South Korea had not ended yet.	0
1004211	The driver can't payback about death, and can't return thet moments.	0
1004212	If someone who is heavy smoker and banned to smoke in the coperation, he could be dizzy in the place.	0
1004213	But the brave rabbit that i met in that temple was different and unique.	0
1004214	They would be annoyed at school's interruption and get a strong agression and antipathy to the school.	0
1004215	Because If it were not for punishment, teacher's control of children would do poor and class become noisy and dangerous, I think that punishment is essential in the class.	0
1004216	The landscape I saw was moving just like a wonderful scene in the film.	0
1004217	Success, not fall down.	0
1004218	Third, I think use people's real name can improve friendship and kindness.	0
1004219	Some people think that physical punishment is necessery in school as a method to protect the authority of teachers.	0
1004220	However, most of students are talking with each other, sending messages in mobile phones, also sleeping.	0
1004221	I have not gone abroad yet.	0
1004222	If they do that, much more people will like completing military service.	0
1004223	I strongly suggest that people can use their nickname or not real name.	0
1004224	Of course some people can say that students can learn that themself with no any physical punishment.	0
1004225	This rule starts at good way.	0
1004226	We have to teach them that right things are have to be done because it are just right and it are not the way that they can escape from teacher's punishments.	0
1004227	In addition, there will be a plus effect on a quality of websites where people can share infomation and opinions about the hot issues or policies.	0
1004228	At the first day we swumed at swimming pool and played soccer.	0
1004229	I become a good person like now by my teacher's punishment that hanppend to lead me to good way.	0
1004230	In last year, there are great movements in my city, Kotoku.	0
1004231	That was really nice !	0
1004232	First of all, physical punishment is not effective to students.	0
1004233	For our children, for our teacher, for our nation's future government should allow physical punishment in all schools.	0
1004234	Like this, My piano can't separate with me.	0
1004235	We dance until club is closed.	0
1004236	The goal of making human is made by kind, humane communication by liberal conversation each other.	0
1004237	At first, it gives me fun of solving problems.	0
1004238	Of couse, I am non-smoker and I heard the news that the second-hand smoking is also bad for health and arising the possibility of cancer.	0
1004239	I think that was one very interinsting in past vacation.	0
1004240	Of caurse serius punishment or emotional punishment is not good.	0
1004241	Humans doesn't have a right to punish others physically.	0
1004242	First of all, it's interesting.	0
1004243	because i think the teacher must teach student`s mistake but maybe if we should not be allowed physical punishment in all schools, many student think the teacher`s teaching so fun.	0
1004244	So the Internet can be healthy space that people debate and make new things.	0
1004245	Drivers of automobiles should be allowed to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1004246	If babies or pregemented women are standing next to the person who is smoking, that would be very critical to the health of them.	0
1004247	I agree that people must use their real name on the Internet.	0
1004248	Hun who is born in 1992.	0
1004249	When I was in middle school or high school, physical punishment was allowed in my school.	0
1004250	Above was the why the smoking should be banned in all public buildings.	0
1004251	Because I cant not see my grandmother anymore.	0
1004252	My favorite subject in high school is English.	0
1004253	If operate physical punishment goes on, it can be a very helpful thing for our children.	0
1004254	Now law doesn't give a smoking section for smokers anyplace.	0
1004255	Some people argue about physical punishment must be allowed because it gives teacher to have power which takes student to be controlled.	0
1004256	Moreover, using animals in medical experiments is also beneficial to animals' survival.	0
1004257	I bought hiphop CD, download hiphop music and lived in hiphop.	0
1004258	Limiting to smoke in public station can help of that.	0
1004259	He is very kind and thinkful teacher.	0
1004260	That's all why I love her.	0
1004261	The punishment needs state line.	0
1004262	She loves me so much and I love her too.	0
1004263	I agree with him.	0
1004264	Because he was very friendly we played together in the subject time and lunch time.	0
1004265	so people should be responsible.	0
1004266	Therefore, it is essential for teachers to advise and physically punish them.	0
1004267	If they are bothered not to smoke the place they are, they eventually decide they should stop smoking.	0
1004268	He says a lot of his information because he want to have a real friendship with the stranger.	0
1004269	i like math subject.	0
1004270	Furthermore, there are other ways to make students behave well.	0
1004271	It makes me a coach.	0
1004272	For these reasons, I think people should not forced to use their real name on the Internet.	0
1004273	But even if animals did have equal rights to humans, we should still be allowed to experiment with them for the greater good.	0
1004274	In our world medical experiments are so necessary.	0
1004275	You gives me a good friend,'Kim Moon Seok'" as well as celebrating massage.	0
1004276	because there are many side effects if physical punishment is not allowed in schools.	0
1004277	Suppose that some of your family is killed by other person who was not concentraing in driving by using cellular phones.	0
1004278	I agree to physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1004279	In this way, requiring users' real name is really effective when it comes to manners on the Internet.	0
1004280	These days, some students attack teachers.	0
1004281	If a researcher find how to reduce the pain of pig's urine container, he can apply the remedy to human.	0
1004282	Military service motivates machoism of Korean men in Korea society which likes brave Korean men.	0
1004283	It's life style that I want to live.	0
1004284	Furthermore their parents feed their children just with love.	0
1004285	With this ability I'm planning to help other children who are too poor to go to English Academy.	0
1004286	He is my avatar and fortune giver.	0
1004287	By this way, nobody need to be hit and It can make students develop themselves independently.	0
1004288	Third, few teachers punishes their students roughly.	0
1004289	Therefore, We don't need many people to build the military force.	0
1004290	because i see such teachers in my high schools.	0
1004291	Both physics and mathmatics need creative thinking and elastic reponsibilty.	0
1004292	I can learn many things from her.	0
1004293	If so, traffic accidents that is occured by phoning driver will decrease.	0
1004294	Some people may say, if phone call is important enough to take a risk, it is reasonable to take a call while driving.	0
1004295	The ring means grandmother's love because the ring was her favorite things and she left it to our family.	0
1004296	By many experiments which have been done, it was proved that animals have emotions too.	0
1004297	Square for eyeshopping, watcing movie, talking and resting.	0
1004298	When I was in high school, I loved English.	0
1004299	He was very considerate and skilled in the mathematics.	0
1004300	The other is very reasonable and behaves like a man.	0
1004301	we can't say our voice because worry about our voice might hurt our private, our family, our life.	0
1004302	It's not a war.	0
1004303	I want to go USA because I went USA when I graduate middle school and I had great time.	0
1004304	Second, I think military service is a good opportunity to socialize as a men in Korea.	0
1004305	Because of a lot of accidents?	0
1004306	There are several reasons.	0
1004307	But giving some hurts or suffers to other is an invasion of that basic right.	0
1004308	Smoking causes many kinds of cancer because cigarettes have a lot of harmful sufficients.	0
1004309	They feel safe even when they say bad words to people that they don't know about, because there are little chances that thier real names are disclosed to the people they spoke bad about.	0
1004310	So drivers use cellular phones while driving.	0
1004311	But in math, there's only one answer.	0
1004312	I usually spend my Saturday playing with my freinds.	0
1004313	First, the animal experiments are essential for a medicine which is used for human.	0
1004314	I have heard that there are many science museums and they have loat of amazing things can make us amused, also they are so huge compared to Korea science museums.	0
1004315	Although I didn't get hurt, the accident was terrible enough to make me scared.	0
1004316	They don't care about what adults talk to them.	0
1004317	Because opinion about problem is sure things.	0
1004318	Outer circumstance that can stop the smoker can work as a key factor.	0
1004319	It has many reason for me to have liked the subject.	0
1004320	And I'm so happy because I have provided what they need in their hard time.	0
1004321	It was very interesting to watch the fun moves of cheering crowds.	0
1004322	My conclusion is physical punishment should not be controlled by the law.	0
1004323	If infants and babies abosorb that smoke, their health and grows are worse.	0
1004324	S. military service program.	0
1004325	This is why I think using cell phone while driving is too dangerous.	0
1004326	Wow...	0
1004327	For example, when a student made a huge problem, my homeclass teacher called him to her office and let him talk why he did that and how does he feel about it.	0
1004328	Although his lecture was not interested, he was humorous and made our class laugh many times.	0
1004329	I was lucky to met him.	0
1004330	If we cannot use animals in medical experiments at all, there will be much more victims who die or get worse because of the side effects of the healing method.	0
1004331	Most students ignore their teacher.	0
1004332	to be better world, using nikname in Internet that save difference must be saved.	0
1004333	Also military service is a law of Korea.	0
1004334	I know that today people use id unproperly.	0
1004335	I think it is right to add social service duty to all Korean people, not men.	0
1004336	I think physical punishment is need to treat students.	0
1004337	But experiments to human are illegal.	0
1004338	But my parents worried if I could success and earn enough money in that hard field.	0
1004339	One animal's sacrifice could be a KEY to millions of people in the world.	0
1004340	Therefore, military service is necessary for all Korean men in the seperated country.	0
1004341	It takes hard times to make sure Korean academic and child-bringing condition to control and allow physical punishment, but it must be very Well-reworded works.	0
1004342	I think that I gain many good things by physical punishment in this term.	0
1004343	School should lead they go to the right load.	0
1004344	Because, they think they usually lose their academic, artistic abilities during 2 years.	0
1004345	But some people carelessly use cellular phones while driving ceaseless, and other stupid people says using cell phones while driving must be allowed.	0
1004346	Actually, plus, that is not a "right", it is an "addiction".	0
1004347	We can have virtual experiments instead of animal experiments.	0
1004348	And they do deserve to do so.	0
1004349	First of all, it decreases the work efficiency.	0
1004350	Then, I and my another friend say sorry each other.	0
1004351	And now, I thank to him that punished me.	0
1004352	In particular, female and older teachers are more ignored than male and younger teachers.	0
1004353	There are many adolescents for studying, but if they finished their work, they usually go to the rest room and then they can be found some cigrettes.	0
1004354	Teacher have to promise rule with chlidren.	0
1004355	This trip had very important meaning to us because it was our last memory before graduation.	0
1004356	They can say bad words to teachers and fight with teachers easily.	0
1004357	In consequence, They lose a chance to get much knowledge because of millitary service.	0
1004358	Some people say that animals also have their own life and they are the organics that should be treated like people.	0
1004359	At that time I respected my friend.	0
1004360	Few months ago I heard what happened in the army from my older brother that had completed military service last year.	0
1004361	Therefore there is no problem to bad netizens to do bad things when we use real name.	0
1004362	and individually, i set a high score to the that point of peoples personality.	0
1004363	I want to feel the happiness again in Brazil.	0
1004364	Secondhand smoking, what indicates that inhaling smoke of non-smokers, can cause many deseases like a cancer or pneumonia, etc.	0
1004365	I have no doubt in my mind that allowing to use cellular phones while driving will lead to more loss of invaluable lives in traffic accidents in the future.	0
1004366	And I don't disagree the bill that men who completed military service can be given plus scores when they came back to the common society.	0
1004367	Also, we have many similar environmental conditions.	0
1004368	and they have a sin that they can't raise children rightly to their ancestor.	0
1004369	But if they use cellular phones while driving, they can threat not only their own lives but also lives of other people.	0
1004370	If physical punishment is not allowed, it would be more difficult to correct a student's behavior because in many cases students who disregard the teacher's words in the first place are likely to do so again when they are only confronted with the words of a teacher.	0
1004371	And there are many people who assert 'This kinds of experiments are right.' or 'Animals must be protected.' People who think experiment using animals are not bad assert that lives of human being always more valuable than anlmals'.	0
1004372	It isn't right way to teach.	0
1004373	Second, after I learn math, I feel that my ability of thought is better than before.	0
1004374	Besides, Austrailia is the best choice among the other countries that I haven't been to.	0
1004375	In the moral view point, Using animals in medical experiments is not moral.	0
1004376	So I and my school friend always anticipate to physical education class.	0
1004377	Also, we could solve problems with communication.	0
1004378	In my opinion, I think that all schools should not be allowed physical punishment.	0
1004379	Because they, as an adult, can judge their responsibility of being civilian.	0
1004380	Also victims by the accidents will have to pay the great amount of money to hospital.	0
1004381	According to one study, human's brain structure was programmed as doing one thing at a time cause if we do other things simultaneously, we get confused and can't even do one thing perfectly.	0
1004382	They might make a big turn or small turn so their car can either go out of road or crash with wall.	0
1004383	because saying bad thing to someone on the Internet using real name is same thing to say bad thing to someone in real world.	0
1004384	Photo album has special meaning for me and my family, because it shows us the happiest moment like traveling or growing up.	0
1004385	And not exist a way to mend a bad action from a bad think.	0
1004386	Lastly, high schools are okay to allow physical punishment.	0
1004387	I want to be a kind and good person.	0
1004388	For the one who sit your next, Think once more before using the cell phones while driving.	0
1004389	For me, I had hard times overcoming stress in high school and I was often disappointed and frustrated.	0
1004390	We can see many articles which say students often make fun of their teachers, and it is happened even during the class.	0
1004391	And yes, something has to be done to correct shools' order.	0
1004392	We can explain it again and again until they understand it in their heart.	0
1004393	it is time to animal be free in medical experiments.	0
1004394	is very famous and delicious food.	0
1004395	Third, there are many people who refuse to serve military for religeous reason.	0
1004396	It is such a cruel thing to use animals in medical experiments.	0
1004397	When the teacher made them use their real name, however, they became nice students and debated well.	0
1004398	So, I think we have to use animals in medical experiments for human lives.	0
1004399	Some of opposed people speak the students have a rights.	0
1004400	Go to fitness	0
1004401	Some scientists have not thought of loving and appriciating to animals.	0
1004402	I usually play game, chatting, web surfing with computer.	0
1004403	First, Many people use public buildings.	0
1004404	And one-thing to do this is do not use cell-phone when drives.	0
1004405	so it happen un-human case less.	0
1004406	So I like him	0
1004407	After the situation, I decided to study english very hard.	0
1004408	No, it is not equal.	0
1004409	It could be; Yes, dogs have intelligence, and so are Mice.	0
1004410	In conclusion, I think the government of our country have to make the rule which is that smoking is not allowed to all public buildings.	0
1004411	Although the place the smokers are smoking is like open places, the smells of smoking can extend to all the flours.	0
1004412	For example, in Seoul, physical punishment is not allowed in all schools lastly, and then, students largh at their teacher, and teacher can do nothing about that.	0
1004413	In Korea, using cellular phones while driving is forbidden with law.	0
1004414	It means that smoker can hurt non-smoker's health too.	0
1004415	There, I run and workout for about 2 hours.	0
1004416	If government can deal with them, budget gets more challenged through solving the problems.	0
1004417	Absurbly No-smoking peole inhale the indirect smoke.	0
1004418	Internet is where everyone can state their thoughts freely.	0
1004419	So we can be in danger.	0
1004420	we make that surrounding so they can survive.	0
1004421	For me and my brother, computer is just a "good memoir" in our life.	0
1004422	But, We also can use Internet in the bad manner like insulting or deceiving other people hiding behind nickname.	0
1004423	Like this case, there are so many casses in this cyber world.	0
1004424	Not all men is healthy and someone has his own thinking.	0
1004425	Medical experiments are necessary for the improvement of medicine, more over, our lives.	0
1004426	But fortunatly there is other ways to punish students that are not violent.	0
1004427	When we went teacher's office he always said hello first and give something to eat.	0
1004428	Physical punishment by school or their teacher can help bad students.	0
1004429	By awarding advantages about vonlunteering the duty from the government, the military can get enough men force to do the work.	0
1004430	Regulate life style and exercise in army made him have high strength.	0
1004431	Because I started my high school study with that subject.	0
1004432	To sum up, the problem is not the matter of using names, and in addition, using real name on the internet can occur another problems.	0
1004433	And the wings of vast variety of applications should be folded when you drive.	0
1004434	My opinion's core is LIVE PEOPLE LIVE ANIMALS.	0
1004435	we should not take this system for granted but we cannot with out it too	0
1004436	For instance, my friends and I usually go shopping in the end of every week.	0
1004437	They would feel uncomfortable and maybe they will try to escape those places.	0
1004438	All of korean men completed military service when they were twenty.	0
1004439	for example , when animals is died , human face global problem that is can be ruin.	0
1004440	Every man should protect Korea by serving military, and every woman should protect Korea by giving new birth so (s)he can keep Korea protected.	0
1004441	Smoking can harm others.	0
1004442	If I have an opportunity to travel in spain, i will go to Barcelona first and buy a lot of things about soccer.	0
1004443	When students are given physical punishment, firstly they feel so bad and feel their teachers hostile.	0
1004444	We can make another ourselves which is ideal to us on the Internet.	0
1004445	So I think goverment should banned hard physical punishmet of childre in schools, and they should admit the physical punishment of children in schools to develop my country.	0
1004446	It doesn't matter whether the time using cellular phone is short or long.	0
1004447	It doesn't look good to wear for a boy like me, but I always wear it because it was the last gift from my grandmather.	0
1004448	The physical punishment means the punishment by hitting or smacking.	0
1004449	They also insist that there is no way to correct them except that punishment.	0
1004450	First, we should take some critics about our opinion of social issues and anything in any situation.	0
1004451	Some people who agree that people must use thier real name on the Internet say that using a nickname on the Internet has problems like bad replies.	0
1004452	Last, he give me much advice to live society.	0
1004453	That why, we could pass many troubles that may happen in calling.	0
1004454	I often had economic's test.	0
1004455	They must.	0
1004456	Most importantly, he cares about me all the time.	0
1004457	Thus we can't guess actually the time when the North Korea's attack will be occur.	0
1004458	For the first reason, if they don't use their real name on the Internet, the society can't resolve the accidents that are occuring at the cyber space.	0
1004459	there are lots of lovely dvd in there so i usually watching them.	0
1004460	Smokers' sweety and happy smoking makes others feel bad hurting their physical and emotional health.	0
1004461	There are lots of thousands of bad substances in the cigar.	0
1004462	However, if all the internet users use their real name, it can be easy to catch the commiters because through their real name, it is much easier to catch them.	0
1004463	Teaching what is wrong and what should have done in that situation by talking is very effective.	0
1004464	I got a lose many times.	0
1004465	I am not thinking of visiting famous landmarks in India.	0
1004466	So school have just two way.	0
1004467	Of course!	0
1004468	If a medical treatment that can cure the disease exsisted, it can have saved lots of animals.	0
1004469	In brief, corporal punishment just worsen the problem of students and there are a lot of ways to ban it.	0
1004470	So the near of the public building has to be cleaned.	0
1004471	Yes it is an application or video playing or something more.	0
1004472	Many people are fighting for themselves to smoke freely or to be escaped from smokes in public buildings.	0
1004473	To carry on this role, punishment is only the way.	0
1004474	We can justify the cruel behavior for saving millions of individuals.	0
1004475	But that is not acceptable.	0
1004476	Traffic accident`s most reason is that many drivers are using cellular phone when they are driving.	0
1004477	A punishment is very useful in changing a student's attitude.	0
1004478	Of course, he has no sin so he didn't get penalty.	0
1004479	In short, I agree any aspect of physical punishment.	0
1004480	He gives all students same love.	0
1004481	I feel happy when I spend Saturdays with my family or friends.	0
1004482	He carefully observed me and tell me many good advices, too.	0
1004483	If we do not prevent physical punishment, there would be children going to the hospital because of school.	0
1004484	Using cellular phone in driving makes accident more harmful than when it happened to driver who did not use cellular phone while driving.	0
1004485	I went to Jeju island last winter vacation with my freinds.	0
1004486	My eyes were extremely small that most friends have teased me that I seemed sleeping, thereby sincerely wanting a plastic surgery.	0
1004487	However, in my opinion, physical punishment is sometimes necessary.	0
1004488	These many case, U.S.A. is teacher's power is very strong.	0
1004489	Most interesting experience in my past vacation is going to ski resort with my friends.	0
1004490	Not only the smokers but also the other get serious damage by the cigarette smoke.	0
1004491	First, Animals are life that we are.	0
1004492	Sometimes we have to make small sacrifice in order to achieve great goals.	0
1004493	For example, One day I came to school late.	0
1004494	And between People's life and animals life, there are not better one.	0
1004495	Moreover, it is really useful for me because I feel shy to talk about my problems face to face, so I usually send letters to be mentored by my family.	0
1004496	When I saw the book about Korea, that book's author said Korea and Italy are very smiliar.	0
1004497	Korea is the powerful country in IT industry.	0
1004498	If this things are done and make a change, physical punishment will be gone naturally.	0
1004499	Therefore, the key to solve this problem is embracing them with our own hearts and reminding them they are special ones to make them trust their own possibilities.	0
1004500	Some celebrities and politicians deny to go there by using their financial and social status.	0
1004501	First, All Korea men have life of himself.	0
1004502	And i meet friends.	0
1004503	To the babies who is still in the mother's womb, it is critical.	0
1004504	Teachers don't have the right to do physical punishment and also students don't need to stand that.	0
1004505	(but it is only OK when students have bed attitued to their teacher.	0
1004506	They may say that eating meet is neet to suvive.	0
1004507	But that point can solve teacher's qulify investigate.	0
1004508	Teacher talks the right way and correct them.	0
1004509	In my point of view, some people might argue that they can do two things perfectly at once, but it is impossible.	0
1004510	Second, driver keeps calling while driving, because of driving, call concentration is not perfect.	0
1004511	Students are also same human.	0
1004512	So I think math is perfect subject.	0
1004513	He is joyful.	0
1004514	He did mistake so he had to go toilet to wash his hand.	0
1004515	After all, i agree to compulsory military service now but in the future we should make military service useless by unification.	0
1004516	And congratulations for your entering Yonsei university~" All the family congratulations for me.	0
1004517	In my opinion, physical punishment should be permitted partially.	0
1004518	and I have girl friend (as you know I`m not good at english but she had some kind of asia fantasy and she sad I crush you I think that is because I`m asian whatever I had grate time with her for 2 month so I right that in this question	0
1004519	So many people think of animal experiment far from humanism.	0
1004520	But my mother have a ticket.	0
1004521	When I was in middle school, I saw a car accident.	0
1004522	I dislike the smoking man on the street and I feel dizzy when I inhale the smoke they exhale out.	0
1004523	We saw everyday in school and academy.	0
1004524	If students sleep in lesson time or they fight with friends , they get some point.	0
1004525	Second, military service can be a chance to refresh one's mind and rebuild one's body.	0
1004526	For example, I heard that just 80 years ago, Japan dominates our nation with more powerful forece, so Korean was used in medical experimnets for Japen.	0
1004527	For example, math has exact answer , but english and language don't have exact answer.	0
1004528	So, to save non-smokers from indirect smoking, smoking must be banned in all public bulidings.	0
1004529	For instance, there are big growing up country by unforced men who work hard.	0
1004530	But almost driver don't have a faculty that do actions at once and it can be proved by the data.	0
1004531	Because children also have some their own private rights.	0
1004532	The original purpose of physicla punishment is that the scolded student will recognize his fault by feeling pain.	0
1004533	The war can happen in Korea.	0
1004534	when I take the physical education class, I feel comfortable and refreshing.	0
1004535	Don`t make disgusting smell.	0
1004536	And I had big problem about future.	0
1004537	It makes non-smokers' nose bitter and it's hard for non-smokers to breath where people smokes.	0
1004538	Internet is meant to be a tool for the people to use it as freely as they can.	0
1004539	In this case, it is difficult to move the steering wheel, especially when there is a curve.	0
1004540	The most memorable place is Geochang, a village far away from Seoul.	0
1004541	When I was second grade in my school, Ksan high school, I want to the sea with my friends.	0
1004542	so I can't play a violin in competition.	0
1004543	There are tow reason for that.	0
1004544	We can check many news that solitude makes many social problems.	0
1004545	For example, if an experiment give subjected animals too much pain, or proceeded in a poor hygine, it should not be permitted.	0
1004546	I think all Korean men don't have to be forced to complete military service.	0
1004547	If drivers use cellular phones in a car, drivers can not pay full attention to driving and can not see sight of front well.	0
1004548	And then whenever I go high school to meet he, she always buy delicious foods.	0
1004549	Therefore I think that this military service program is very completed program.	0
1004550	First of all, students' behaviors become terrible when physical punishment is prohibited.	0
1004551	And USA has even amazing scenic sights like yellowstone and grand canion.	0
1004552	For example, last year, when North Korea attacked Cheon	0
1004553	So that all korea men be forced to complete military service is not useful.	0
1004554	But I think that using our real names can also cause many disadvantages.	0
1004555	At that time i cut every connection with my freind.	0
1004556	And It can influence their mental abilities, also.	0
1004557	In the circumstance when, there can't be too much in paying attention in drivning, using cell phone can be higly dangerous.	0
1004558	because most people are child and woman.	0
1004559	I cannot help appreciating him now either.	0
1004560	And many people think like me.	0
1004561	Because The vice answer people is hurting people and sometimes killing the people.	0
1004562	South Korea has one of the most strongest military forces.	0
1004563	when I am in high school, I lost that ring, and It was found in 1years after.	0
1004564	They can think and listen as other adults.	0
1004565	One of the most memorable object is telescope that my older brother gave me in my birthday.	0
1004566	Because they cannot be prepared for their future whereas the other people - especially women- can be prepared for their future.	0
1004567	Instead of physical punishment, we should use another means to make the students active.	0
1004568	That means I didn't do anything special.	0
1004569	i think smoking in the public building is so terrable.	0
1004570	But not all teachers do that.	0
1004571	Instead of forbiding smoking in all public buildings, government will set up proper amounts of smoking-rooms and broadcate the public commercials about non-smoking.	0
1004572	However during summer, the most memorable exprience is that I went to school's top floor with my friend to see stars.	0
1004573	To conclude, all Korean men should complete military service as it can be beneficial, and it is needed in current situation.	0
1004574	Smoking's harmful substances can make people ill not only through air, also through many subjects all around us.	0
1004575	So it match with my picky and objective mind.	0
1004576	I liked earth science especially.	0
1004577	When teachers give physical punishment to children, almost of them have scratuer in their mind.	0
1004578	That ever involves acident.	0
1004579	While doing those behaviors, they don't feel any anxiety because people cannot find out the real person because they cannot match his or her real name with nickname used on the Internet.	0
1004580	And the idea that all men should go to the army is very strange in even point.	0
1004581	So iplay basketball or poketball with my friends.	0
1004582	She understands my situations well, sometimes gives me some advise and always makes me laugh.	0
1004583	Yes I agree.	0
1004584	A person who uses cellular phones while drinving is the man who is very selfish.	0
1004585	When I recently see newspapaers and TV, there are always accidents that a student hit a teacher or dispute a teacher.	0
1004586	This means that they could spend money for just one call with concentration in it but they are spending twice more.	0
1004587	but make the specific rules about physical punishment can solve that problem.	0
1004588	These things can make the children wander and have wrong mind.	0
1004589	Also, better comments would be presented that might be helpful to that person.	0
1004590	Without the preparation, we cannot control the tense between the north Korea, and it can make the situation worse.	0
1004591	But It can't be in real situation.	0
1004592	The environment around public building will be dirty.	0
1004593	Though animals are really valuable, some animals' dedicates(though they not agree this dedicates) help the medical development.	0
1004594	Second, she's very sweet.	0
1004595	So I was given a big help by her.	0
1004596	Distributed attention of drivers can cause serious accident.	0
1004597	Sometimes, I spend making rice, steak, cake.	0
1004598	I like a female mathematic teacher.	0
1004599	He also likes playing soccer like me.	0
1004600	I spend 3days going around Jeju island in a bus.	0
1004601	She is very kind to all student.	0
1004602	For these reasons, I can say with no doubt that the Holy Bible is very special for me and my family.	0
1004603	So, if other solutions for misbehaving students are not ready, just like modern korean educational system, physical punishment should remain for not only teachers, but for all the educational environment and students who want to get good educational services.	0
1004604	However, I don't think that using animals in medical experiments is a right thing for human to do.	0
1004605	she allways cares our family.	0
1004606	Third, not only teachers but also students have their own rights not to be hit by others.	0
1004607	She was very fat.	0
1004608	Teacher's rights to enlighten their children in any way are their businesses, not other persons'.	0
1004609	In the past, most of people thought that teacher gives physical punishment to students becaue he loves them.	0
1004610	because if these internet cites use the real name, people may not be honest to their opinions being afraid of the country power.	0
1004611	As a man of citizen, we may well get military service and we think positive about this service period.	0
1004612	Suppose flu virus attacks Korea.	0
1004613	How can we know what is useful to us or bad to us?	0
1004614	and so was i.	0
1004615	in the mountain.	0
1004616	In addition, In class project, I made movies with foreign friends, and we became very close with each other.	0
1004617	Many good programs are brodcasted.	0
1004618	The physical punishment of children in schools can lead the students to right course of life.	0
1004619	Like other humen, all child has right to be loved.	0
1004620	First of all, each students is an each person and a son/daughter in their own family before being a student in their schools.	0
1004621	Of course, before the actual experiments, we should take enough time to paper test.	0
1004622	When school student perform unright performance or take a mistake there are many opthions that teach student for right way, except physical punishment, like present for good performer or encouragement present for not superior student.	0
1004623	i'd like play basketball.	0
1004624	Although Franch language's grammer and words are very difficult, learning that is exciting.	0
1004625	For example, reading a book or go out of the classroom is more justifiable.	0
1004626	People have to think that animals are our friends, not tools for helping humans.	0
1004627	He is English teacher.	0
1004628	It may seems that some people have right of making air pollution, dust and medical problems.	0
1004629	It was really good.	0
1004630	It cannot be adjusted.	0
1004631	To protect our earth and our health we need to make powerful law.	0
1004632	Also it gives people the knowledge that smoking should be stopped.	0
1004633	I think all the people choice people's life.	0
1004634	It can help to develop not only the students but also the society.	0
1004635	Because just the reason that they use their real name....	0
1004636	Old palace is very wonderful architecture.	0
1004637	This is bad thing.	0
1004638	because at the military, they never study.	0
1004639	Some one said like this.	0
1004640	Some bad people sell koreans privacy information like phone number and private number to other countries.	0
1004641	So we have to make solutions.	0
1004642	Having talking time to understand students and teachers each other can replace the physcial punishment.	0
1004643	I do not agree with the phisical punishment of children in schools.	0
1004644	Elementary school students are too young to understand the profound meaning of physical punishment.	0
1004645	I was very surprised at that size of tomb, and good protection.	0
1004646	If drivers hope to use phones, they should stop driving.	0
1004647	Think about it!.	0
1004648	We went to same high school for 3years.	0
1004649	Its impact is very awesome.	0
1004650	I will never forget my teacher's advice even if I meet the hard times in future.	0
1004651	Secondly, there are absolutely many people who use smart phones with touch screen in these days.	0
1004652	".	0
1004653	But He call me often and worry about my problems.	0
1004654	So I want to get the chance to use my Chinese.	0
1004655	Drivers can use only less than a minute to get everyone safe including himself.	0
1004656	I can't agree with experiments with animals.	0
1004657	Thus, thesedays my friend and her brother get along with each other and do not fight a lot as they used to be.	0
1004658	They cut his hair and phoned me and said "I don't want to go to military.	0
1004659	Those are his very good virtues, so i want to be like his personality.	0
1004660	Still, It's same as before using the real name.	0
1004661	I do agree that people must use their real name on the Internet.	0
1004662	No smoking people are so sick in this.	0
1004663	I like to go to Japen because first, Japen has beatiful scenes and very nice city, For example Tokyo is world best city in cultural and baseball.	0
1004664	How could this happen?	0
1004665	We should let them know what the mistake was and why it happened, and what they have to do not to make mistakes.	0
1004666	But I think that punishment of children is not always right.	0
1004667	When I was frustrated, he gave me a lot of hope.	0
1004668	That information is secreat , but everyone must know about that information.	0
1004669	Because of it, people don't express their real opinion.	0
1004670	But now cats and dogs and other animals that are in care of the humans hand use the medicine when they are sick.	0
1004671	Also, he made us do some physical activities.	0
1004672	so I take the class more hard.	0
1004673	I think that teachers in schools should exercise physical punishments to children for some reasons.	0
1004674	There students may be more creative than the other, but not all them.	0
1004675	Instead of it, by giving minus point or disadvantage in their school life according to their misbehaviors, students can learn the rule of 'what goes around comes around'.	0
1004676	Second, not the smoking person but the people who do not smoke will be influenced much more from smoke.	0
1004677	Because he is very generous to all student.	0
1004678	Because since I was a middle school student, I have been interested in the culture, economy, and democratic system of US because of its power that has strong effect throughout the world.	0
1004679	But for smokers who disagree the smoking ban, the smoking room would built in public buildings and street.	0
1004680	They said that in military, there was so many bad person like gang.	0
1004681	For example, when I was in slump during high school 3rd grade, she said to me that when she was high school student, she had a slump that I have also!	0
1004682	Garlic snowing pizza is the pizza in Mad for Garlic.	0
1004683	At the same time, people do not smoke are influenced by the fume in indirect way without filtering process.	0
1004684	I would like to go Europe if i have a chance to travel.	0
1004685	If there are no objects to use in experiments, human beings might use human beings.	0
1004686	If I wasn't, I can tell you her funny stories and then it would make you laugh.	0
1004687	He was my homeroom teacher when I was second grade's student.	0
1004688	In school, most students can be considerred as children.	0
1004689	But these days, some people don't want to complete this service because of their religions and so on.	0
1004690	Smoking is very harmful to everyone.	0
1004691	So, I have a lot things to do.	0
1004692	I had been there when I was in middle school, and I really enjoyed it.	0
1004693	When it was my birthday, he wrote a letter to me and it made me really feel good.	0
1004694	if people use real name on the Internet, people obey the rules probably.	0
1004695	In that time I like Biology most in such a subject.	0
1004696	for these reasons I like math best.	0
1004697	Anyways, in my opinion, I am for the physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1004698	If the results of the research brings more good things to the earth, we can't help but using animals in medical experiments.	0
1004699	So she never give up the students who do wrong things.	0
1004700	Hacking, cyberfighting,deceiving and fraud is prevalent in our society.	0
1004701	making a good internet envirnment can be a plan.	0
1004702	Because students will not follow new rules, and same situation will happen.	0
1004703	For example, famous Korean actor Hyun	0
1004704	My high school goes four mountains in high school life.	0
1004705	Second, he has never stopped learning to improve himself.	0
1004706	So this camp was so meaningful.	0
1004707	My best subject is Math.	0
1004708	Because of experiments of animals are useful of medical, bioloy and other science.	0
1004709	A name is one of the most important private information.	0
1004710	Not only it's ugly but it can harm or kill people.	0
1004711	I think prohibiting the physical punishment can allow the teacher's.	0
1004712	For korean men, the military service can be a disturbing work or bad news.	0
1004713	Should obey the laws and not drinking and no cellular phones.	0
1004714	If I have a chance to travel, I go Germany first.	0
1004715	This can be accepted by who disagree to using of animal in medical experiments.	0
1004716	And All the people in our country needed to courage our children's thinking way to have a duty to military service.	0
1004717	So, for example, if driver is in situation of car crashing, standard driver,who is not using cellular phone in the situation, will turn the handle rapidly to avoid upcoming vehicle, and will get less damage from car crash.	0
1004718	By these reasons, I claim that drivers should be prohibited to use cellular phones in their car while driving.	0
1004719	In this aspect, phone using while driving must not be permitted.	0
1004720	Since fire is very dangerous in an oil refinery smokers should go out of the factory to smoke.	0
1004721	Student will sleep more and more.	0
1004722	But today, the skills for preventing that problem is so developed.	0
1004723	In Japan, I went Osaka.	0
1004724	So she wanted to rest for some periods and her parents also decided her to do.	0
1004725	It was very clean and fresh.	0
1004726	Yes, it is a right opinion.	0
1004727	So, using anonymous membership would be better choice than that.	0
1004728	I often had a lot of stresses while study hard on desk.	0
1004729	No!	0
1004730	After I say them my English grade They smile me anything.	0
1004731	Camera is one of my favarite machine because I like to take photograph especialy stars or faces of people.	0
1004732	And that money doesn't gives them any benefits.	0
1004733	And, She is very active person.	0
1004734	First, every people have right to pursue pleasure.	0
1004735	Using cellular phones while driving a car should not be allowed.	0
1004736	But, military service is very long and awuful to some people.	0
1004737	These are why i disagree at it.	0
1004738	I have some reasons for this.	0
1004739	In conclusion, the laws should ban the drivers using cellular phones while driving unless we may face many car accidents made by cellular phones.	0
1004740	I agree about punishment but should be different by their age.	0
1004741	First, I'd like to introduce about the advanced countries' school rules, the Europe's.	0
1004742	To solve the problem, we can give the teachers reasonable rules for the punishment.	0
1004743	Second, some people said that, animals are not immportant like humans, so to save humans life, we should use them.	0
1004744	I also like to go swimming with my friends and family, and we usually go to the beach or a swimming pool when we don't have enough time to go far to the beach.	0
1004745	There are so many reasons that we have to do the experiments.	0
1004746	So, I went a famous academy in Gang-nam.	0
1004747	I cannot forget this travel.	0
1004748	today, instead of using ear-phone, using bluetooth is also good method to use cellular phones while drivers are driving cars.	0
1004749	So we are in serious situation.	0
1004750	Is it effective?	0
1004751	I did best in Japanese in high school.	0
1004752	Such primitive 'teaching' method should be abandoned from schools as soon as possible with out question, for they do go against the student's rights as a human being.	0
1004753	Teacher loves their students like students' parents.	0
1004754	For example she knows what she can do and when she can do something.	0
1004755	She and I are the same age but sometimes she is acting like my older sister.	0
1004756	He punished us and taught us the community.	0
1004757	What should we do?	0
1004758	It is only the other side of our mind which is covered by our real names and doesn't mean more than a communication.	0
1004759	So they didn't change after hearing many advice.	0
1004760	And, so many people hate smoke smell.	0
1004761	Because these days many students fight with thier teacher or make them funny.	0
1004762	etc, but those of positive sides could be dangerous, so I have worry about dangerous point of it.	0
1004763	I study in Chinese high school.	0
1004764	Of course, The punishment from teachers heatred is not allowed.	0
1004765	People are happy not to consume 2 years and society are happy to expand national ability and status.	0
1004766	Just making it banned to smoke in public buildings and no resolution means that he forces smokers to stop smoking.	0
1004767	Because smart people in Korea will be the leader of the korea.	0
1004768	We know very much each others.	0
1004769	Second, There are so many internet flaud caused on the internet network.	0
1004770	If we do medical experiments with human, it will take longer time to produce new medicine.	0
1004771	Furthermore mostly these calls do not take long.	0
1004772	Children are not fully aware of relation of responsibility and free before they become adults.	0
1004773	We almost spend the whole night talking and laughing together.	0
1004774	Making smoking room in public buildings is the solution.	0
1004775	Nowadays, many women volunteer for military service.	0
1004776	So my opinion is that smoking should be banned in all public buildings but those buildings also should have smoking places so that smokers can't affect bad influence to non-smokers.	0
1004777	In military service, we can meet a lot of person.	0
1004778	Most people think teachers use physical punishments because student's behavior is not good.	0
1004779	I have these experience.	0
1004780	When I first entranced high school, I was very noisy student and famous troublemaker.	0
1004781	However, animals' life's value can't be measured in money or time.	0
1004782	Surprisingly he was charged for fake.	0
1004783	But there are some disadventages in using their real name.	0
1004784	I think this period is very important to theri lives.	0
1004785	There are three reasons that I think in this way.	0
1004786	There are a little black goat.	0
1004787	Already many TV stars are dead.	0
1004788	It is too dangerous to use medicals to human even if there are no bad reactions from animals.	0
1004789	First, Diseases are so dangerous that we can't take experiment that use humans.	0
1004790	But I think that it needs to punish the children who do bad acts and break rules in schools.	0
1004791	Even in the red light, it also dangerous using their cellphones in their car.	0
1004792	I think we have to stop doing the physical punishment and make alternatives to it.	0
1004793	It should educate teacher the fact that Cruel punishiment is a crime.	0
1004794	No need to talk about North Korea's threat, military force is indispensible key at this international world.	0
1004795	From the time when I only live with my mother and brother, the plate was never taken and used.	0
1004796	he always read poets with his soft voice.	0
1004797	Some people may argue that hands-free devices can decrease the risk of accident.	0
1004798	This is what we need in teaching.	0
1004799	in addition, i read newspaper to ready for dibates with my friends.	0
1004800	I will miss him	0
1004801	Often we have different idea.	0
1004802	Like human, animals don't want to be killed for other purposes.	0
1004803	Also they can get trust, and be responssible.	0
1004804	the most one of what makes me like him very much is that we have lots of common favorites.	0
1004805	that is the most big problem in our nation.	0
1004806	In Saturday I often go to watch a movie alone.	0
1004807	In short, they can use it when it is clear that the students don't listen to them.	0
1004808	This is a great way to concentrate better on my studying.	0
1004809	They also weaker than ordinary men.	0
1004810	I think physical punishment should be allowed in all schools.	0
1004811	I think fine level have to be so high.	0
1004812	Obviously, inhibiting smoking in all public buildings is an useless way in that the policy wouldn't make individuals quit smoking.	0
1004813	First of all, because, the wars of today is not war of the soldiers number but war of TECHNOLOGY.	0
1004814	Hotel's swimming pool was big enough to play all day long, and very exciting.	0
1004815	Well, I hope they quit smoking but it's too hard thing.	0
1004816	I don't agree that all men should complete military service because it is unnessasary.	0
1004817	You know you are also once a child!	0
1004818	The second place of my tavel is the stream.	0
1004819	The environment in korea military is very bad.	0
1004820	For example, in the board, people can communicate each others and make friend easily.	0
1004821	Or making them to write paper for their sin.	0
1004822	For their jobs, talk to family or friend, hobby and ect.	0
1004823	I was a student of Daegu National University of Education.	0
1004824	Also, babies or pregnants are vulnerable to smoke.	0
1004825	All we need is peace and human source is the precious things that anybody can't interrupt.	0
1004826	when drivers use his ear-phone, he is more carful than no use ear-phone.	0
1004827	rather, opponants think more strong solution to make the people don't pollunate the internet.	0
1004828	When the physical punishment was prohibited in Seoul, it caused many problems.	0
1004829	Every medecine has its side effects.	0
1004830	I agree that we must use own real name on the Internet.	0
1004831	In this site, the number of bad reply and bad story decrease a lot.	0
1004832	And it can make patients die.	0
1004833	she has many information about English.	0
1004834	First, physical punishment such as hitting hips with a stick is not a behavior a student should learn in school.	0
1004835	Moreover, If the drivers have to receive the phone call because it is so important, they can park the car side of the road and then they can receive the phone call.	0
1004836	It means smoking can damage other people's health, who are around with the smoker.	0
1004837	He has a leader ship and have a good freindship so many poeple like him.	0
1004838	Maybe their parents want to prevent their kids from smoking.	0
1004839	Some people say the physical punishment harms the human rights of students who are punished.	0
1004840	Recently, many students are not listen to their teacher.	0
1004841	Even though drinking while driving seems much more dangerous to safety, both attitude during driving can have same serious accident.	0
1004842	I think the picture on wall of my room has special meaning for me.	0
1004843	But I think it is good suggestion that smoking should be banned in all public buildings.	0
1004844	if medical experiments are conducted, do they know who and which is medical experiments's target?	0
1004845	Without power, warmness, faithfullness of him, I can't go YONSEI university.	0
1004846	If someone used cellular phones as he or she drives, consentration would disperse.	0
1004847	So allowing smoking in all public buildings includes a high possibility to make many people be in danger of fire incidents.	0
1004848	Her mini-homepage address was uploaded at many sites, and many internet surfers visited her homepage, saw her pictures, and write replys.	0
1004849	First, she has a positive mind.	0
1004850	So for these two reasons, Mathematics always my best subject not only in high school but also in my whole life.	0
1004851	From then I strongly support the idea that animals have emotions.	0
1004852	Becase this fact, many man have stopped studying and working.	0
1004853	Smoking in public should be banned.	0
1004854	For the two points about this problem, i propose several ideas about it.	0
1004855	But only physical punishment I disagee.	0
1004856	In that case, powerful rule must need for liberity of non-smokers.	0
1004857	For example lee hwai chang's son didn't go army and some entertainers didn't go army.	0
1004858	now the math is easy for me', i'm encouraged to keep teaching and happy.	0
1004859	They make school problem and other students make troblemaker!!!!!	0
1004860	It can make a risk of traffic accident.	0
1004861	In these days, people drive a lot and use cellular phones a lot too.	0
1004862	She listened my story which anyone can't understand.	0
1004863	But we have special state that the only country that has been broken.	0
1004864	Teenagers are effected a lot by their friends.	0
1004865	Some people believe that animals should not be used in medical experiments.	0
1004866	I think that it is right decision.	0
1004867	It's really problem.	0
1004868	We have to protect them from the violence.	0
1004869	As soon as i was born, We have to meet together in one house to raise up baby.	0
1004870	When we arrive at rehersal place we knew rehersal is only for who pay for orchestra.	0
1004871	But after they use their real name they'll say more good encouraging words than bad words.	0
1004872	At that time, my mother was taking care of my grandmother who had been illing for a long time.	0
1004873	For this reasons I can't dislike him Two years have been past since my graduation.	0
1004874	I think physical punishment is not an avoidable thing for both students and teachers.	0
1004875	That's very important.	0
1004876	Medical experiments are used people.	0
1004877	This is main point.	0
1004878	And If we use animals in medical experiments, we are just murderer.	0
1004879	I agree with that people must use their real name on the Internet.	0
1004880	i traveled alone!	0
1004881	If she was not my homeroom teacher, I would fail to admission university and give up my dream.	0
1004882	He think he is smoking in outside so it will never influence me.	0
1004883	so i did feel like king in the basket courtes.	0
1004884	I know car drivers can use cellular phones while driving with a handsfree.	0
1004885	Therefore for survival of this earth's creatures and reducing the pain of humans we have to sacrify the animal's dignity and we have to develop medical science rapidly.	0
1004886	As a conclusion, all the drivers of automobiles must not be allowed to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1004887	It has Pros and Cons.	0
1004888	First, I could go out and enjoy things with my friends.	0
1004889	But, these punishments give me a strain so I was not lazy and I was respectful to teacher and friends.	0
1004890	Their usage is very useful in our busy life.	0
1004891	Moreover, you can say that using those tools are more dangerous because drivers can be less catious.	0
1004892	Also, there are haman-made islands that look like the map of the world near the shore of Dubai.	0
1004893	Just trust yourself and dream higher.	0
1004894	For example there are a few case that celebrioty's son who is healthy is not go to military.	0
1004895	Something like learning a computer skill for doing military job or doing a paper work in the military office and etc.	0
1004896	Because my mom majored in English Literature so when I was young my mom often sang English songs, chant etc.	0
1004897	It's much like something to care not to affect others who dislike it, something can be done for one's leisure.	0
1004898	I want to visit her soon.	0
1004899	so teacher warn him about talking.	0
1004900	That is why I want to travel Japan first.	0
1004901	The first reason is that the success or failure of wars in these times is not depended upon the number of soldiers.	0
1004902	Of course, we cannot ban smoking because people have the right to smoke freely.	0
1004903	Hands free earphone or blutooth earphone are helping drivers lately.	0
1004904	So, after that, they would remain rude.	0
1004905	I liked math best.	0
1004906	There are many ways to sustain military and it is less important to increase the number of soldiers.	0
1004907	So, If physical punishment not be allowed, teacher's power would be very very weak.	0
1004908	However, this is wrong habbit.	0
1004909	But if you look in the media, you can easily see articles about school class problems.	0
1004910	There are many ways to warn kids in class instead of physical punishment.	0
1004911	So I did my best as they did.	0
1004912	I saw many things about its bad results.	0
1004913	Then they should find correct solution with cooperated and peaceful way.	0
1004914	Rather, it will become morally manered networking sociaty.	0
1004915	I also usally walking around my home for my health body.	0
1004916	He had a great personality and he was very generous to me and my classmates.	0
1004917	I like to talk with him about our dreams, thinkings and some kind of problems of our life.	0
1004918	Students have to learn how to behave after they do something wrong.	0
1004919	many people hurt and die.	0
1004920	i even scared that event.	0
1004921	Because students are not adult, so they might distort teacher's mind.	0
1004922	At time, I was in the hospital.	0
1004923	But if we can find this people, and make a punishment, we don't have to use a real name.	0
1004924	It is really important that people share the opinions and debate each other in democracy society.	0
1004925	But 'not using' has more disadvantages.	0
1004926	I think this opinion is also right, but if we use real name, there are more disadvantages and problems versus advantages.	0
1004927	It costs money to clean them up, which is using money on thing that could be avoided.	0
1004928	Today, parents attend their children very protective.	0
1004929	Educationers do not have right to limit other's right.	0
1004930	She always worried about my health and academic parts and help me as possible as she can.	0
1004931	In summary, with these three reasons, I think that we must use animals in medical experiments.	0
1004932	In my opinion, drivers of auto mobiles should be prohibited to use cellular phones while driving the car.	0
1004933	I interpreted this question in two direction.	0
1004934	It is because people can not act with a thinking that nobody knows me.	0
1004935	I have a specail book that its name means "if you study like this, you can enter good university".	0
1004936	So they want to use nickname.	0
1004937	This could make children to hide their thinking and deprive them of confidence.	0
1004938	After finish the film, he had us write our opinion adout that.	0
1004939	Another reason to ban smoking in publicj area is people who smokes spits and threw burned cigaretts everywhere where they had smoked.	0
1004940	I don't want to see any accident by some driver's phone call.	0
1004941	Last, smoking in public buildings destroies the cleanness of the public buildings.	0
1004942	All of these things happens because people hide in fake identity and behave irresponsible on the Internet.	0
1004943	The dreams came true and our family happily draw left eye on it.	0
1004944	we sad.	0
1004945	Another reason is that I want to see all those wonderful places, which I saw only in pictures, with my own eyes and enjoy the trip.	0
1004946	Becuse we don't have any ability to revive dead person, we must do our best to do not accidents.	0
1004947	My habit is my words are noy good.	0
1004948	I like my best friend and his voice.	0
1004949	Our students are looked many beautiful picture by Janpaness teacher.	0
1004950	And to increase all chidren's average mark, it is quite powerful way.	0
1004951	We think about that seriously.	0
1004952	So it has some scars and spots but still I love it.	0
1004953	They do not become obedient.	0
1004954	First, I think the study is important in my life but a friend relationship is also important.	0
1004955	I mean-Drivers of auotmobiles should not be allowed to use cellular phones while driving but there is a replacement : using earphones.	0
1004956	I has taken his help in the very variety situation too.	0
1004957	We can easily see scientists use animals in medical experiments, tearing and killing them.	0
1004958	So they have many exprience than me.	0
1004959	I think forcing to complete military service all Korean men is not good policy.	0
1004960	Moreover, he even lived in environment.	0
1004961	Some people think why our contry's men should be forced to complete military service and other contry's not.	0
1004962	So when a man has to take military service, their family always worry about him.	0
1004963	Few years ago, there was the combat in Yeon	0
1004964	If not, smoking room pollut around it.	0
1004965	And I always think I have very good friends and thanks to them, I have a really happy school life.	0
1004966	Sometimes he told me jokes and give me cookies.	0
1004967	For these reasons, I think all Korean men don't have to be forced to complete the military service.	0
1004968	So they do many bad things, using no regulation.	0
1004969	So they can make their on-line name or change the name freely and express themselves by using their new name.	0
1004970	For instance, my uncle who drives and also have cell phone, uses a phone holder so he shouldn't have to hold the phone himself while driving.	0
1004971	And I think people must use their real name like a real world.	0
1004972	on conclusion, I think that all Korean men should complete military service.	0
1004973	If we don't use our real name on the internet, it could be dangerous.	0
1004974	Some people say that physical punishment is effective way to teach students.	0
1004975	Then he soon forgets about what he did wrong because he already paid for that.	0
1004976	It's too selfish and cruel thought.	0
1004977	I do not care about the people who are killed while enjoying their freedom to use cell phones.	0
1004978	I have breakfast at the snack bar under the mountain after the 1-hour mountain climbing.	0
1004979	And I also agree that those kinds of punishment should not be allowed.	0
1004980	what is that?	0
1004981	Then, Her anger is melting and we will hug and say that i love you.	0
1004982	The policy that all Korean men without any physical problems should complete military service has to be changed.	0
1004983	I thought that it was my precious time to retrospect my mistake and understand teacher's mind.	0
1004984	So although country or some site assert to use real name, it can't be possible.	0
1004985	There can be a disagree with this statement saying that it is overreating.	0
1004986	At evening, I watch TV talk show or drama.	0
1004987	In many stories, most impressive story I heard was bread baked at Paris' restaurant.	0
1004988	This is dilema.	0
1004989	Because since I was 16, I have wanted to travel to Europe and wanted to see the soccer game.	0
1004990	so answer in math problem is not changed.	0
1004991	And we played a firework.	0
1004992	This act should be banned by laws.	0
1004993	So I ban smoking in all public buildings.	0
1004994	Instead, we use them to develop our medical theory so that they lose their families, and I think we'll be regretful about doing that things in very soon.	0
1004995	However Physical punishment is easy finish.	0
1004996	to me this past winter vacation was very meaningful time	0
1004997	Some one said an actor must die bacause he hated the actor.	0
1004998	I want to go to U.S.A if I have a chance to travel.	0
1004999	I was't good at studying.	0
1005000	I like my best friend so much, because she has a kind person.	0
1005001	Thesedays, as right is emphasized, the number of people who disagree with the physical punishment of children in schools is increasing.	0
1005002	So I think, when we use some animals for medical purpose or something good, we have to treat them as they can't feel pain.	0
1005003	It can be made by communicating.	0
1005004	Here are a few reasons.	0
1005005	So I want you to say sorry to your friend.	0
1005006	First of all, the relationship between North Korea and South Korea is not good these days.	0
1005007	He was the most important person in our family, not just my father and mother.	0
1005008	I like her very much because she makes students interested in politics and is very kind.	0
1005009	But soon, most of drivers use their mobile phones while driving.	0
1005010	For these reasons, I assert that all Korean men have to finish their military duty.	0
1005011	Making children be kind and careful person with sensible word is another teacher's obiligation.	0
1005012	When I first heard the news in the United States, I felt quite sad about the unfortunate situation in Korea because I am opposed to the physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1005013	No, I don't think so.	0
1005014	I heard her class, My math grade is very high.	0
1005015	But I think smoking should be banned in all public buildings.	0
1005016	Bad students suffer their physical sick and then they think that I really have bad things about school lecture.	0
1005017	Therefore Many korean people think that smoking in a all public buildings is banned.	0
1005018	However, because of the danger of korea these days and shrinking military force without forcing it, I firmly belive that compulsory military service is a best solution in many diverse opinions in these dangerous days.	0
1005019	People who write bad reply will want to do that using their real name.	0
1005020	If there are the smoking rooms at public buildings, smokers can smoke whenever they want, and non smokers can work at clean environment.	0
1005021	' We have to seek new way for medical experiment.	0
1005022	my beatbox practice course is very nice and surprising event in my life	0
1005023	Of course, we must not allow to use cellular phone while driving.	0
1005024	In that duration, there are many possibilities to them like studying about diverse knowledge or planning their futere.	0
1005025	Some people rob of other people's name and use it.	0
1005026	So we have to use real name on the Internet.	0
1005027	At last, car accident is harmful to other people.	0
1005028	It has only one answer to one question and what i have to do is just find the way to accept the answer, which can be counted a lot.	0
1005029	Threre are many drivers who use cellular phones while driving thesedays.	0
1005030	But that day, we wanted to forget all everything so we played all we want.	0
1005031	the feeling 'tight' do not have students feel teachers not easy.	0
1005032	First, physical punishment gives children feeling of shame.	0
1005033	I like Franch language subject, because I'm interested in learning foreign language first.	0
1005034	So we use animals in experiment to not kill the human.	0
1005035	I hope that I don't go to the military.	0
1005036	Because playing soccer is good for health and I am very interesting for meeting people.	0
1005037	So I feel more attractions in literature.	0
1005038	I am not trying to say that human being's are prior to animals, but I am saying that we cannot just stop them from exploiting animals since it is so essential these days.	0
1005039	So I'm so proud of it and I can do my best to learn my mother word.	0
1005040	other people think physical punishment in school is irregal and is just old fashion.	0
1005041	But using celluar phone needs your concentration like driving.	0
1005042	We must make the rule.	0
1005043	That's not a spirit of Democracy.	0
1005044	For example, ploblem students can have opportunity activities that can fix the ploblem.	0
1005045	And smoking in public area can effect on the health of other onsmokers.	0
1005046	So each person act carefully to their friends, their thoughts will be much better.	0
1005047	For example, we could play soccer and basketball with him.	0
1005048	These days I often spend my Saturdays watching American movies.	0
1005049	The reason why i wrote diary everyday is that the diary was like a friend for me.	0
1005050	For instance letter, neckless, ring and others.	0
1005051	And now we can continue medical experiments without animals through developed technology.	0
1005052	But this year so I thanks to my ancestors, because I think they take care of me.	0
1005053	In long term of military service, most of men can't concentrate their study.	0
1005054	These possible problems were already happened many times and have been in newspaper article.	0
1005055	Many computer experts can find someone`s IP, trace it and expose his personal information.	0
1005056	So, goverment and NGO have to watch carefully schools.	0
1005057	Military service is the most basic thing to protect our country from the fear of war.	0
1005058	but in the same time, Christ said human being has the duty to protect and raise their environment.	0
1005059	The smokes destroy second hand smokers' lungs without their will, and finally brings lung cancer.	0
1005060	Also, students can have a bad attitude when they are scolded by physical method.	0
1005061	Tobacco has many chemicals, and it would not good for the nature.	0
1005062	Don't be scare the fail".	0
1005063	that house was in Orewa near by beach.	0
1005064	Because of physical punishment, schools can be upgraded increasingly and establish a strong base.	0
1005065	However, I agree with the statement that animals can be used in medical experiments because of humans and keeping extincted animals.	0
1005066	But If students do the same wrong thing many times teacher have to take red card.	0
1005067	She is also a good adviser for me.	0
1005068	Anyone can't punish people.	0
1005069	That is a soccer and computer game.	0
1005070	And teachers should know that children don't need the physical punishment.	0
1005071	Physical punishment should be forbidded in school.	0
1005072	My familly all like playing tennis , so we often play tennis .	0
1005073	Although I have visited once when I was young, the travel has remained as beautiful memory.	0
1005074	It will take a lot of times and money.	0
1005075	So people can make biology robots that can replace with animals.	0
1005076	I got passed at the English ability test.	0
1005077	For last thing, it is really fun when we are together.	0
1005078	women had a role in society, too.	0
1005079	Heavy smokers' cannot adjust their smoking well.	0
1005080	He have to concentrate presentation!.	0
1005081	some people propose military service is enough.	0
1005082	And we have to punish the man who make problems.	0
1005083	Most teachers punishes their students for love minds that their students become good people.	0
1005084	In playgrounds, children can have accidents by playing with cigar by making a fire or have a breathe because of the curiosity.	0
1005085	Because they will be our nation't leader.	0
1005086	But if the bad situation continues next time the teacher requires more harsh and intense punishment.	0
1005087	The subject I most loved in high school was P.E.	0
1005088	Teenagers are not matured enough.	0
1005089	It`s very seirious problem.	0
1005090	There are only a few techers who give physical punishment to satisfy their own desire to beat someone.	0
1005091	On the Internet, people can't see other and even don't know who the person is.	0
1005092	So, when the student's point is at some standard(for example, 30 points), the student have to do something such as volunteering, cleaning bathrooms by school's rule.	0
1005093	The reason is that P.E class made an oppertunity to make friends, get to know each other and also helped to build partnership.	0
1005094	But if we forcify the program of using real name on the Internet, we can make Internet environment very comfortable and wonderful meeting place.	0
1005095	In november, Young-pung-do got attacks from north Korea.	0
1005096	I'd like to go to New York city in America.	0
1005097	My best friend name is Kim jiyoung.	0
1005098	Worse than that, Big groups like goverment and big company could interrupt about interver current.	0
1005099	Like this, we have lots in common.	0
1005100	People who likes to smoke can smoke in areas which do not ban it.	0
1005101	They can't play on the ground even one minute.	0
1005102	and evening, I usually play piano at home.	0
1005103	It has been an important issue whether people should use their real name on the Internet or not.	0
1005104	So I consult with teacher.	0
1005105	I saw and read lots of cases that people suffer from lots of diseases which caused by their close people who smoke just because they were with them.	0
1005106	Like cure for his wounded part of body, make their habitats area greenbelt, ban killing the animal.	0
1005107	Because when physical punishment should not be allowed, students will deny teacher's command.	0
1005108	It has a different feeling compared with contemporary building, so watching old palace could fresh my mind.	0
1005109	If it's too hard to ban all smoking in public buildings, rooms for smokers should be prepared in public buildings.	0
1005110	But the real problem is nationwide addiction to cigar.	0
1005111	So I like to study English in England.	0
1005112	Controling stundents with words would be the best but it has a limit.	0
1005113	Why Using phone on driving has high risk?	0
1005114	because my ex-girlfriend gave this book for my birthday, and 7days later from this day, we broke.	0
1005115	And with that knowledge about kids, teachers can understand students' felling and mind so that the problem of subjected student can be solved.	0
1005116	Also, we can replace physical punishments with nonphysical ones.	0
1005117	That`s the reason why math is my favorite subject	0
1005118	And now Japan says let children study hard.	0
1005119	Generally while listening to the music, it made me hard to study.	0
1005120	Because of adults' conventional and even conservative thoughts; Children are typically unconsiderate, people have thought that physical punishment is an unevitable way to breed a child.	0
1005121	It had originally been my uncle's, who also loved music and guitar in his adolescence, and which means that it is older than I am.	0
1005122	I was so worried that I couldn't study well.	0
1005123	This is that there is physical punishment to regulate students' behavior in schools, and same time It had better that there are educations to teach basic social manner for students.	0
1005124	The friend who gave the ring said silver has the meaning of 'protect'.	0
1005125	So next day I finding the information about the india and I have a resoultion In the summer vacation I must go India with my friends.	0
1005126	For I used it too long, I fight my parents.	0
1005127	It can raise student's responsibility to obey school's rule.	0
1005128	The book said that because of that history, Korea and Italy are very similiar.	0
1005129	Thanks to it, I could solve my problem easily through much better way and I got a lot of lessons from them.	0
1005130	Even if drivers use their mobile phones while waiting for green lights, it can also threaten their safety by taking their attention from traffic lights.	0
1005131	As our constitution say, Military service is a duty of Korean men.	0
1005132	Smokers' act, which is smoking, to be happy seriously trespasses non smokers' rights to health and happy life.	0
1005133	The real equality in goverment service can be applied, too.	0
1005134	Also, it can't be 'punishment', it is just a 'force' to be shown to students.	0
1005135	He don't try to reslove the question.	0
1005136	If the caller is important person(ex: grandmother, 119, 112), he disaccerate his car to 30Km/h.	0
1005137	We can't disregard their existence.	0
1005138	When I was depressed, I listend their songs.	0
1005139	I am sure that we can find better solution than the physical punishment.	0
1005140	However, it become a one of the hot potato.	0
1005141	That means, both the smokers and non-smokers exist in the same public building.	0
1005142	I feel tired and hurt my arm.	0
1005143	So they can live long in earth.	0
1005144	Of course, both pros and cons have their own meanings.	0
1005145	This result shows that phisycal punishments could limit the students' thoughts, creativeness, and learning abllity.	0
1005146	punishing somtimes can be serious social problem.	0
1005147	Secondly, the situation of road gets worse.	0
1005148	It made me go ahead and remember my own dream.	0
1005149	When i weighed these views, good points were heavier than the others.	0
1005150	It is necessary to force all Korean men to complete military service, for right now.	0
1005151	To sum up, all people have their rights to speak.	0
1005152	May others think it is just a old watct because of its age and look.	0
1005153	People can choose it by personal preference.	0
1005154	For not misleading, I don't say all, but some cases.	0
1005155	I like poet because of its ability to remind people of someone`s feeling.	0
1005156	Third, for minorities who can't do the military service.	0
1005157	But Using real name become duty, these opinions may disappear.	0
1005158	The biggest factor in prohibition of the physical punishment was because some teachers punished their students so harsh that the students felt vey ashamed of being punished by the teacher.	0
1005159	I think you should listen their music.	0
1005160	and they also say human right can be suppresssed in army.	0
1005161	Nowaday things are changed and our way of living also changed.	0
1005162	He always say hello whe he met students, and had big smile on his face.	0
1005163	I do several activities at saturday when I didn't have some untemporary schedules.	0
1005164	That is, he likes watching movies and reading books.	0
1005165	The most important thing is, when we use animals, we should be at the side of humanright.	0
1005166	This feeling can makes students' confidence be destroyed.	0
1005167	So we would better make a policy that makes people use their real name on the Internet.	0
1005168	No, I don't agree with this law.	0
1005169	Especially, indirect smoke is more harm than direct smoke.	0
1005170	Second, using virtual name might create more monetary crimes on the Internet.	0
1005171	They insist that it may protect the people who are suffering from bad languages of Internet reply.	0
1005172	I get up about 10 o'clock.	0
1005173	We can make good internet enviorment	0
1005174	It's same to driver even though they got used to driving a lot.	0
1005175	Also, i want see a many good things in new york.	0
1005176	So I think we have to try hard to diminish animal using experiment.	0
1005177	When this happends again and again, things will be worse in real danger situation.	0
1005178	However if their use their virtual name, they more make a joke each other using the virtual name trait.	0
1005179	This custom was oriented from Korean Religion.	0
1005180	If somone answer the phone while drive, the peole may not pay attention on their conversation.	0
1005181	Also in korean proverb there is 'if you don't spank your child when they doing wrong then you will spoil your child'.	0
1005182	Second reason that I stand against with the idea of using real name on the Internet is that security system for controlling personal informations is not perfectly developed yet.	0
1005183	If we use our real own name they might be hacked and use your money or something else they can do.	0
1005184	So the money is necessary.	0
1005185	I can feel subtle meaning of Korean word which I can't realize in English or other foreign languages.	0
1005186	My favorite teacher in high school was my English teacher.	0
1005187	Earth have been through many adversities like ice ages but many living things in Earth didn't died at all, which means confusing nature versus ice age, ice ages is more disastrous than this problem we are facing.	0
1005188	While driving, drivers have to focus on just driving.	0
1005189	And to prevent them to be murderers, more harsh laws are demanded.	0
1005190	These things also happen when students don't abide by their school's rules.	0
1005191	Japan is the country located at short distance in korea.	0
1005192	Students are also "people" ho can share same rights like humans all over the world.	0
1005193	But they forgot about important FACT.	0
1005194	I disagree that people should reveal their real names on internet.	0
1005195	One years ago, geong gi and seoul education principals did stop punishment in all schools.	0
1005196	In addition, she always hangs on my word, I can talk frandkly about my own problems Because I went different high school with her and I lived in dorm, we could not meet that much for 3 years.	0
1005197	And school can be confued.	0
1005198	However, people use fake name on the Internet, people not be threatend, so people will be reveal thier opinions and facts very much.	0
1005199	Thus, they can not notice all signals, warnings and even pedestrians on the road.	0
1005200	Through this experience, I learned everyone can be friends regardless of nationality.	0
1005201	his parents ask me to teach his younger brother but brother said "it is hard to teach me even if it is just a month".	0
1005202	If writers use their real name, they will not write bad writings.	0
1005203	It is hard to change the conception about the punishment.	0
1005204	Is it good phenomenon?	0
1005205	Consider the purpose of the physical punishment, it must be based on.	0
1005206	In my opinion, smoking on streets should also be banned.	0
1005207	Then, I usually do health training to fit better.	0
1005208	So Korean men should be always ready to protect women, kids and our country.	0
1005209	Besides of Pizza and Spagetti,, Italia also has fame about fashion.	0
1005210	Since there are substitute that can be used in medical experiments instead of animals, we should try to use that substitute instead of animals.	0
1005211	My mother manage her stocks and father check trains by the computer.	0
1005212	My family have many photo albums.	0
1005213	Miliary duty is important but human right take priority.	0
1005214	As many people know, animal's body system is very similar with human.	0
1005215	But it is a really wrong oppinion.	0
1005216	As a result, it is not against the Human Rights because government do not have to force all Korean men to complete military service.	0
1005217	So I want that drivers of automobiles don't use cellular phones while driving.	0
1005218	Under whatever conditions, pre-test must be taken, then there remains only one choice, using human in medical experiments by giving much money to people who are willing to participate in.	0
1005219	It is needed to them to be alert in using cellular phone while driving; making law may be quite exact precription.	0
1005220	Therefore, my thinking of subject is sure.	0
1005221	Because if you don't agree those regulations, you can cost your life.	0
1005222	It can hurt someone's feelings or mind and make people do this behavior again in another site.	0
1005223	Also, people express themselves on the internet by using various nicknames.	0
1005224	But Human are really valuable.	0
1005225	So the people can't prohibit animal experiments unill the new experiment is founded.	0
1005226	so i`m very sad.	0
1005227	Nobody have right to deprive all Korean men of their valuable times.	0
1005228	He often fight his girlfriend but he apologize to her right away.	0
1005229	and then l play table tennis with friends often.	0
1005230	Modern war just need buttons to shoot missiles and attack other country.	0
1005231	Some parents and students insist physical punishment should not be allowed in all schools.	0
1005232	But it is really hard to quit once addicted.	0
1005233	And parents must watch carefully their children's school.	0
1005234	This arguement has been issued before long, and i think all Korean men should not be forced to complete military service.	0
1005235	As I am the freshman of universty, just few months ago I was high school student.	0
1005236	The second reason is mind scratuer of children.	0
1005237	Beacause I liked to knowing about meterials around me.	0
1005238	I think All countries comply with singapor but smoker also has human right, Let's ban smoking in all public buildings!	0
1005239	I can prove it through the suicide of actor or singer who suffer from insults.	0
1005240	But now I appreciate them very much.	0
1005241	And students of those schools must keep the schools' rules.	0
1005242	When we think the place is good, we take a picture over and over.	0
1005243	The car was overtaken and all glasses break away around the car.	0
1005244	At least, public buildings MUST ban smoking.	0
1005245	If all schools have not been allowed any physical punishment, the student is copied one by one.	0
1005246	He already knows many things about baseball, such as the lineup of every all star game.	0
1005247	car accident is danger, bad.	0
1005248	I want to go to United states of America first.	0
1005249	These days we want good health.	0
1005250	I used to live in Gwangju when i was in middle school, so this short vacation after the university entrance exam, i visited that place again.	0
1005251	They are weak, pure and fragile.	0
1005252	Just like calculate something important quickly.	0
1005253	But I don't think that all Korean men should be forced to complete military service.	0
1005254	It is due to the supports that experiments with animals could maintain the high value of human beings with dwindling budget to be alloted and faster delivery to hopeless patients with current medicines.	0
1005255	First reason is that, it is so bad for people's health.	0
1005256	I agree with the physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1005257	Usually there is point system.	0
1005258	But people cann't.	0
1005259	They can not choose fresh air of filtered air.	0
1005260	In cigarette, there are lots of substances which harms one's health.	0
1005261	When i was young, my mom gave me a present for me.	0
1005262	Drivers watch and listen roads to check if there is any danger on there.	0
1005263	But Many people deny using cellular phones.	0
1005264	No life is more significiant than other life.	0
1005265	Second, Ironically teacher has many power.	0
1005266	This made me like math.	0
1005267	Letting the smokers smoke in private places, or outdoors would create a sound smoking culture that will lead to better environment for everyone to live on.	0
1005268	And poor concentration make their resoponse time long.	0
1005269	Not only calling but also other functions of phones should not be allowed for drivers becasuse of the safety problems.	0
1005270	Also on my diary, I wrote about Yonsei University many times because it was the university where I really wanted to go.	0
1005271	When you listen to his music.	0
1005272	Yes!	0
1005273	At first I think that this is just enjoyable work, but time is go...	0
1005274	We have to handle them very carefully.	0
1005275	Therefore they don't know how their parents lived in savage environment.	0
1005276	We can spend our first day of weekend very happily.	0
1005277	First of all, my favorite subject is math, so teacher who teaches math can easily be my favorite teacher.	0
1005278	Then the country will need more money to provide them medical support and to import more cigarettes.	0
1005279	I really wanted to taste wines made in France.	0
1005280	But they don't use other things.	0
1005281	That time is my adolsent period.	0
1005282	When Korean noticed the news, many men criticized the men who don't want to get military service.	0
1005283	If they complete the military service, they will take care of their parents more kindly.	0
1005284	He was nice to them.	0
1005285	I agree that people must use their real name on the Internet.	0
1005286	Why non smoking people is hated in health by them?	0
1005287	Also, there are some researches that show how harmful it is to punish young students physically.	0
1005288	However, unfortunately, if there are no friends available to play with me then I usually clean my room or turn music on loudly and sit in the bed reading fiction books.	0
1005289	My best friend is Eunha Kang.	0
1005290	So, the letter has the special meaning to my family.	0
1005291	If this place is in a building, the problem gets worse.	0
1005292	And many people have different opinions on it.	0
1005293	I have nothing memories that are able to called interesting.	0
1005294	He had a job as a translater in international porum.	0
1005295	I disagree to the opinion that people should use their real name on the Internet.	0
1005296	Also, for achieving to ban smoking in the buildings, government's trying should be required.	0
1005297	In that using cellphone while driving bothers driver's concentration, and it can be connected with car accidents, It should not be allowed.	0
1005298	First, Physical punishment can make students more objective to the school.	0
1005299	My grandmother reserved a resort so my family including my grandparents went to the resort.	0
1005300	So for these reasons, I liked Geography most out of all other subjects.	0
1005301	He give me some advice.	0
1005302	I think school have to make children good adult not bad adult.	0
1005303	And, used in medical experiment animals has through out who they owner.	0
1005304	Also, physical punishment is often better than mental punishment.	0
1005305	Anything can't threaten non-smoker's right to live without harmful surroundings.	0
1005306	because if the punishment not be allowed in all schools, many rude students will cause very many problems.	0
1005307	Those who argue diffrently might say that they are completly capable of driving safely while using their phone and they might say it's only going to be few seconds.	0
1005308	The great important reason is hard of finding replacement.	0
1005309	That is, human is most smart animal so human can use other animals in medical experiment.	0
1005310	If Korea keep forcing young men to complete military service, it will only reduce efficiency.	0
1005311	The more people are, the more seriously the building will be in chaos.	0
1005312	When people are driving, they should focus on his or her drivng, not a cellular phone.	0
1005313	Hence, smoking should be banned in all public buildings.	0
1005314	The brave is weapon to teacher.	0
1005315	Those physical punishments sometimes had rules or forms that were told by teachers at the first day of semester, but most of them were impulsively or instantly acted.	0
1005316	a!	0
1005317	Also, punishment has bad things, in news, there are news about some over-punishment.	0
1005318	And I'm interested in paintings and novel.	0
1005319	And I go to home and watch my favorite TV program named "Moo han do jeon", eat dinner with my family.	0
1005320	Other solution is we give the right for the physical punishment to some teachers.	0
1005321	A few are really helpful and have possibility to share others' oppinions.	0
1005322	It causes many non-smoker's health problems.	0
1005323	When I had some trouble with study, He showed me the way how I study and, from time to time, he gave me serious words about routine life.	0
1005324	So in all public buildings smoking should be banned.	0
1005325	So nation should said to people through broadcast and campaign not to use cellular phone.	0
1005326	But not overdo.	0
1005327	When a man or woman take the handle, not only he takes the responsibility of his life but he takes the responsibility of other's life.	0
1005328	So, he is very famillar with me.	0
1005329	I think that schools have not punishment of extremely wild teachers.	0
1005330	That is very dangerous.	0
1005331	I think that all Korean men should complete military service.	0
1005332	But saying of teachers has many limitations.	0
1005333	Also, physical punishment creates more conflicts between teachers and students.	0
1005334	If use physical punishmet, you must cognite him or her what they had wrong thing.	0
1005335	For example, because durgs are used for those who are illed, safety of the durgs are essencial.	0
1005336	This has so many disadvantege than advantege.	0
1005337	To study korean language I always practice making a paragraph to a sentence.	0
1005338	And I'd like to have this activity forever.	0
1005339	So punishment that doesn't make children feel terrible, should be understood.	0
1005340	(since It takes money).	0
1005341	Most of all, the best thing through the Politic was that I could have a pride of a Korean.	0
1005342	it is so easy, i like those way.	0
1005343	I hadn't ever board a plane.	0
1005344	Many scientists and doctors also feel sorry for using them in their experiments, so they do not intend to give them more pain during procedure.	0
1005345	If anyone bad reply on a opinion(or photo) of other person(sure just kidding or joke), but a person wirting a opinion on the internet can be shocked.	0
1005346	I like soccer and also play very much.	0
1005347	Once students are punished by teachers, they have a bad feelings about teachers.	0
1005348	).	0
1005349	And it is not a problem for drivers of automobiles themselves but problems for many other drivers and people on the road.	0
1005350	Though the behavior, smoking is only done individually but the result and the effect are not limited only to the individual.	0
1005351	Fourth, i read a book.	0
1005352	My grandmother don't leave there.	0
1005353	Nobody agrees with that humans should be used in medical experiment.	0
1005354	Even if USA helps South Korea, when we reduce our soldiers, USA can turn to enemy.	0
1005355	If drivers of automobiles using ther cellular phones while their driving, thay have to very harder pay.	0
1005356	So I know much about the history.	0
1005357	thus I think forcing military service is very unjust.	0
1005358	I think Internet is a tool through which we can have useful information.	0
1005359	they are so young so they don't know this behavior is bad thing and so rede.	0
1005360	The most important reason is that he loves students whole-heartedly.	0
1005361	To specific example, when I had a diet at a restaurant, someone smoked behind me.	0
1005362	I cannot change the letters with anything in world.	0
1005363	I think school don't need physical punishment.	0
1005364	Except for issueing bills, As they construct more somking sections, then both benefited.	0
1005365	Then we sing for Jesus together and talk about our feelings or thinkings about the sermons to which we listened in the morning.	0
1005366	Finally, we have to protect children' rights.	0
1005367	For these reasons I liked physical education the most and if someone asks me about my favorite subject, I will clearly say that my favorite subject is P.E.	0
1005368	Also, The informations include weathers, locations, population, and a detail information about special place.	0
1005369	In research, childrens conform to the teacher easier when punished physically than when counseling or talking in words.	0
1005370	Because body is related to human emotion.	0
1005371	People can't do both driving and hanging on the phone at once properly.	0
1005372	Because he is active and talktive, anyone who meet my friend likes him and wants to be his friend.	0
1005373	His every single face expression, movement, tone of his voice was excellent and when he sang a song it was really touching.	0
1005374	I like playing basketball, so do he.	0
1005375	I was quite poor at math, and he knew that.	0
1005376	Because people can hurt other's feeling if their names are nor shown.	0
1005377	We can't solve this problem only our hand or goverment.	0
1005378	And we have the moment that must be called someone who is important person.	0
1005379	and i ask them what is appropriate?	0
1005380	Also, teachers should be educated thoroughly to become the respectful teachers and to instruct students effectively but gently.	0
1005381	so we do behave this thing are not lie.	0
1005382	Psychologists had communications with him.	0
1005383	She teached math interesting method and understanded me more easier.	0
1005384	So because I don`t like violence and love piece, I have no choice but to agree that physical punishment is needed to teacher, and it must allowed in some degree.	0
1005385	Because teachers abuse their ability to punish students.	0
1005386	Because I decided to spend at leastly 2hours to read books in weekend, I usually spend times read books in Saturday.	0
1005387	Finally I got entered this University.	0
1005388	Hunting for fun and Medical experiments both kill animals, but hunting for fun kills animals only for fun.	0
1005389	Second, our country's population is too low to keep military only for aplicants.	0
1005390	I firmly insist that the smoking should be banned in all public buildings following these 2 reasons.	0
1005391	But Many people think that the use of cellular phones while driving causes an accidents except me and say that I can drive well while using cellular phone.	0
1005392	From this experience, I realized that physical punishment is the best way for the troublemaking students.	0
1005393	Korea is divided into North and South Korea because of different ideologies and Korean war can be resumed anytime.	0
1005394	I think my best friend is cool and humorous.	0
1005395	When we went to mountain climbing, we had an oppertunity to ride an elephant.	0
1005396	play, practice, and play.	0
1005397	But other people on the internet are damaged from our treat.	0
1005398	This situation, animals can be very useful.	0
1005399	Despite the fact, human right should be at the top of any other rights because we are humans.	0
1005400	Showing real name on the Internet is one of the most important issues nowaday.	0
1005401	If people use their own name, their writings or other things will remain at the site with their names.	0
1005402	another reason of denying the physical punishment is that the physical punishment can rob the children's interests of study.	0
1005403	It makes we can think the smoke sensor and camera will be reduce the smoking in nonsmoke places.	0
1005404	So I think the opinion that smoking should be banned in all public buildings is wrong.	0
1005405	And then, parents can know their children more correctly and controll their children in their house, too.	0
1005406	I usually meet my friends these days.	0
1005407	This gave me a chance to think about my future seriously.	0
1005408	Here is my few reasons.	0
1005409	they can feel pain and they can eat some food they can think about other animals.	0
1005410	We went to Haeundae at night.	0
1005411	And the government should tell parents the necessity of physical punishment.	0
1005412	This mind can affect the other's mistake or accident, so prevent them early.	0
1005413	And he study well.	0
1005414	Another reason l strongly disgree with smking in public area is fire.	0
1005415	Talking on cellular phone makes driver's mind fade.	0
1005416	I agree with above opinion.	0
1005417	First of all, there are too many side-effects of not using their real name.	0
1005418	If I have a chance to travel, I want to go to Japan first.	0
1005419	It was difficult.	0
1005420	I want to say that going to speech&change Academy is the most interesting experience in this vacation because it was some new experience for me.	0
1005421	The subject that attracted me a lot was English.	0
1005422	After all, i agree that people must use their real name on the Internet.	0
1005423	But now, I think it is time think about thier sickness and their feelings.	0
1005424	These ways I disagree that people must use their real name on the Internet.	0
1005425	My view on this issue is that we should ban smoking in all public buildings.	0
1005426	But the physical punishment of children in schools is not always good.	0
1005427	First, This is because there are a lot of things to do in America.	0
1005428	It was great time	0
1005429	So internet world is very kind and peace.	0
1005430	This experience gave me a of gamble addiction.	0
1005431	And at that time some people use human as a tool of a medical experiments.	0
1005432	Why?	0
1005433	Second thing is self-esteem that I am protecting my family.	0
1005434	This was the core reason for my motivation to study further and better at math.	0
1005435	the first is honest.	0
1005436	when meet each we can have time for good.	0
1005437	and finally i heard good news.	0
1005438	Firstly, It is very terrible problem to write slangs without thinking others.	0
1005439	No, we should not used animals in medical experiments.	0
1005440	He will goes to the high school this year and he feels little pressure about it.	0
1005441	Parents want the teachers to spare the rods for their children because they think their kids are so fragile, and they are so innocent that they do not deserve to get punishment from teachers.	0
1005442	When teachers teaching the lecture, the punishment may be essencial.	0
1005443	I feel proud when i watched bike, but i stealed it when i was 18 years old.	0
1005444	If people do not need to use their real name, the police can not find them or find them in extremly difficult environment.	0
1005445	So, smoking should not be prohibited so strictly in a way such as being banned in all public buildings.	0
1005446	And he is also my club, traditional tea, supervisor.	0
1005447	When I and my friend were middle school student we weren't good student.	0
1005448	My best friend is who I met in my high school years.	0
1005449	First, In military, one can experience many things and can learn more about life that cannot do in society.	0
1005450	My car accident's cause was a mam who was driving while using cellular phone.	0
1005451	if drivers, who crushed or being crushed, get any injuries, it would also cause lots of money lose to pay for them.	0
1005452	so if teacher wants to teach children, they would using wards, not physical punisment.	0
1005453	But movement that people have to use their own name spreaded on society, fake advertisements were reduced and even if they post fake advertisements, we can find him easily and punish them quickly.	0
1005454	My favorite teacher of high school, and actually not only high school but all schools, was the physics teacher.	0
1005455	Democracy respects all civic rights including right to choose.	0
1005456	It could cause the social problem, actually, it already has.	0
1005457	Both teachers and students would not be able to get accustomed to new rules immediately.	0
1005458	Animals have been used in medical experiments for human beings.	0
1005459	However, there are some people who are against wars, according to their belief or religion.	0
1005460	My family's dog have special meaning for my family.	0
1005461	Medias like television let us know the risk of second-hand smoking.	0
1005462	First of all, the driver of automobile who can not concentrate on driving has a lot of dangerous situations.	0
1005463	This shows that Korea is not a safe place and Koreans should aware of the likelihood of war.	0
1005464	So when students grow up and become adults, they can punish their children or students physically too.	0
1005465	Second, when we have a hard time, we could rely on each other.	0
1005466	However before the punishment, teacher and student agree with that when teacher can punish their children.	0
1005467	The rat's DNA or other something I don't know very well, is almost similar with human's.	0
1005468	As we can see from this case, it is too ahead for korean to reveal their name in the websites.	0
1005469	Whenever I meet her, She says many stories which she experiences to me.	0
1005470	If the governments do not find efficient solutions shortly, more serious problems will occur.	0
1005471	Especially rock and metal music.	0
1005472	The example of Kyonggi province shows that the prohibition of physical punishment bothers the effective learning of the class.	0
1005473	but I think doing yoga is much better for men than women.	0
1005474	If this legal take actions, drivers who use cellular phones while driving should pay the fine.	0
1005475	when teacher use the prize to motivate their students, these students wouldn't follow their teacher without prize.	0
1005476	Seorae which has more than 160 chains is the store that sells beefs and folks.	0
1005477	We know that country is very cold.	0
1005478	Schools needs a discipline.	0
1005479	Mom and I love that time.	0
1005480	and sometimes he talks about my fault so directly that I get mad.	0
1005481	For example, when I watch a variety entertainment program, I laugh at seeing program and it makes me happy.	0
1005482	But I believe physical punnishment should be allowed in all schools, for the following two reasons.	0
1005483	Parants are most good teacher.	0
1005484	I aslo agree with this measure because of mainly two reasons First, smoking can be dramatically harmful to people who are not really related to smoking.	0
1005485	Drivers of automobiles should not allowed to use cellphones while driving.	0
1005486	There lie both bright side and dark side, but it is true that we did develop our medical techniques by many expreiments.	0
1005487	On the contrary, these days' families have only one or two children.	0
1005488	Drivers think incessly the event, and it appears driving skill.	0
1005489	Some people think there is no problem using cellular phones while driving, while others think it is really dangerous.	0
1005490	I think that my favorite teacher in high school is a homeroom teacher who I met in my 3rd grade.	0
1005491	And they can be more irresponsible.	0
1005492	in the beach, i wish to walk the bottom in the sea.	0
1005493	So I loved studying Math for a long time.	0
1005494	When I see the picture I recall the my joyful time like field trip, housewarming party, school festival and so on.	0
1005495	If I behave something good i can get a good apple sticker.	0
1005496	we have to use time in confirm us.	0
1005497	However, a student will not do something that made him punished.	0
1005498	I likely to feel shy about me so I didn't even try to meet and hang around with girls.	0
1005499	Without physical punishment, students respected teachers and teachers tried to understand students.	0
1005500	If there were no animals there couldn't be any humans.	0
1005501	The tree stands out and shine so fabulously that those who visit my home are amazed.	0
1005502	Therefore, thesedays, lots of people start smoking because they believe that it is good at realieving stress and making people comfortable.	0
1005503	I think there is no exception in serving.	0
1005504	I favorite teacher is sunhang Kim.	0
1005505	The 'vague people' should work in militray related place.	0
1005506	So bus and taxi drivers should be more careful about using cellular phones.	0
1005507	second idea is using car.	0
1005508	For it is very huge, it is really hard to circulate the inner air.	0
1005509	We even went to Jeju-do with car.	0
1005510	Because that subject have some interest.	0
1005511	Second, Physical punishment cause mental sicknesses and uncleanable hurts.	0
1005512	Because my brother is sports-man, my brother teaches me very much.	0
1005513	Others think that forcing right for the military service can worsen the situation.	0
1005514	Strong govenment can give many things to citizens.	0
1005515	I'm really sorry and thank to the animals used in medical experiments.	0
1005516	etc.	0
1005517	On the Internet world, there are many online trades.	0
1005518	Therefore if that experiments were used for specipic company or personal, this institure can warn it.	0
1005519	In my opinion, especially at middle school and high school, physical punishment is unavoidable.	0
1005520	One of the most frequent causes of car accidents is using cellular phones while driving.	0
1005521	We don't have to use animals all our experiments.	0
1005522	As China grows rapidly in various sectors such as politics, economy, and education, we cannot talk about the today's international reality without mentioning China's circumstances or opinions.	0
1005523	Every life is very important.	0
1005524	Although there are many persons that hate their names, but they should always think their real name.	0
1005525	Korea has the greatest power on the Internet.	0
1005526	Smoking is also one of their hobby.	0
1005527	For me, it was a first time being a teacher to someone and it was also a first time making money by myself, taking teaching fee from my parents.	0
1005528	For developing biology it's inevitable to kill animals.	0
1005529	And then, When I back to home, eat breackfast and ride a bycicle.	0
1005530	But I disagree that people must use their real name on the internet.	0
1005531	At that time I was very excited to meet another friends from many other places.	0
1005532	Because I majored in chinese in the past when I was highschool student.	0
1005533	and give money back to me.	0
1005534	we are surprised.	0
1005535	The reason is that they couldn't endure netizen's saying on the Internet.	0
1005536	Because they don't want to be harmful to their family.	0
1005537	My class lost a soccer game, but he impressed the next game and was a partner.	0
1005538	Some people can say, using people's real name on the Internet can reduce the damage by bad replies.	0
1005539	l also used to visit her in order to ask solution.	0
1005540	I could always get highest score in the chemistry.	0
1005541	After class I usually meet my girl friend to go theater or cafe.	0
1005542	If these people take part in military service, they can decrease the efficiency of the military system.	0
1005543	In my opinion, however physical punishment should not be allowed in all schools.	0
1005544	However the mistakes are not punishment's object.	0
1005545	Maybe we fail to our goal, when we are old this fail was very critical.	0
1005546	Anyway, I agree with the physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1005547	This anusual common music interest made us a lot of thing to talk about.	0
1005548	I'm not a religious person, but I agree with equality of living things.	0
1005549	Because That's very unethical.	0
1005550	If a man who doesn't want to go to the army, they don't go.	0
1005551	Therefore, since I have a nice harmony with Hawaii and hope to experience more, I like to visit Hawaii the most.	0
1005552	Everytime I'm on ski slope, I am highly thrilled.	0
1005553	Stop studying due to military service will be very significant loss to Korea in the future.	0
1005554	Moreover, there is no need of animal experiments in contemporay society.	0
1005555	Second, There are no plus-point.	0
1005556	When 2006 winter vacation I went New Zealand to improve my English conversation and meet my friend.	0
1005557	Many customs which have been doing like the physical punishment give a lot of loss for mentally and also physically.	0
1005558	And Mt.	0
1005559	So our animals are very useful to world and we should care them very carefully.	0
1005560	So if students think it is good advice from their thecher, whatever they got little hurts they get the bigger knowledge to their life from them.	0
1005561	And she was my homeroom teacher of 2nd grade.	0
1005562	so people must use their real name on the internet.	0
1005563	opponents who do not agree the punishment say that physical punishment don't have that effect.	0
1005564	At that time, their brain and body are matured and perpect to start something like their vision.	0
1005565	For these reasons I think drivers of automobiles is not allowed to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1005566	Correct threat exist in this peninsular.	0
1005567	One of my friends went to Osaka.	0
1005568	Human should not make nature and ecology system as they want.	0
1005569	But there are one thing that teacher must keep.	0
1005570	I can talk to him about any topic and he would not slip a single word to anyone else.	0
1005571	If we were not obliged to go military service to young Korean men, nobody would do that.	0
1005572	This is currently using, and it is working.	0
1005573	And good friends can measure like a great teacher.	0
1005574	Next, The policy would make a stripe to become a culturally developed country.	0
1005575	Second, drivers cannot concentrate in driving while using cellphone.	0
1005576	For example, Japan did not let children study hard.	0
1005577	The half of people don' like smoking and it is also bad to our health.	0
1005578	money penalty is one thing, and public's eye have to be base.	0
1005579	At first, you can think it may need more money than using animals.	0
1005580	So, we should prevent drivers from talking on the phone.	0
1005581	Do not over.	0
1005582	After playing badminton with my friends, I feel good and also my health is going better.	0
1005583	Go ahead."	0
1005584	for children is saved from this situation, teachers or parents have to use physical punishment to teach children about seriousness of mistakes.	0
1005585	As I was a high school student who had to study whole day, it was not helpful to listen to music while memorizing or understanding something.	0
1005586	All public buildings exsist for many people include smokers and non-smokers, and smoking there is rude to non-smokers.	0
1005587	To strengthen the military power, army size should be considerable.	0
1005588	When people is calling, it is natural to concentrate on listening and speaking so it makes disconcentrating on driving.	0
1005589	Sometimes I have extra time, I play the piano in chuch.	0
1005590	It makes them unhealthy.	0
1005591	so I read science book usually and I like it.	0
1005592	For example, in germany, when the light of the store was offed and became completely dark, many things in the store were stolen.	0
1005593	It can make students learn in quite, good place and help them know about the courtesy and rulls of the society.	0
1005594	They should be freed from killing chemicals and have safe environment around.	0
1005595	Because of this I really think the physical punishment is need, but not severe punishment like hit the hip with a bat.	0
1005596	But the previous story was obviously happened infront of me, and I shoked.	0
1005597	I never meet that person in my life and he or she wouldn't consider this comment seriously, and wouldn't do some act to me.	0
1005598	In conclusion, I agree with the physical punishment of children in schools, because it sometimes needs and can prevent next bad behaviors in before.	0
1005599	In my oppinion, All Korean men should be forced to complete military service.	0
1005600	According to the research by health minister, eighty percent of non-smoking people who use public buildings agree with banning of smoking in public areas, because they want to keep their health.	0
1005601	But teachers hold notion of punishment that teacher should give their children what is bigger fault.	0
1005602	Then let's talk about why we have to ban smoking in all public buildings.	0
1005603	I have some friends.	0
1005604	You should change your way to talk.	0
1005605	it was so shocking to me.	0
1005606	It's also applied to driving situation.	0
1005607	I think drivers of automobiles should not be allowed to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1005608	Sometimes, it is not useful to those of extremely violent students.	0
1005609	So I play basketball twice a week.	0
1005610	Therefore we should have more power of military through compulsive military service.	0
1005611	so l like my ball	0
1005612	It is very unfair.	0
1005613	In these reasons, we have to give teachers the right of punishing their students.	0
1005614	Nowadays, using cell phone while driving has become an issue.	0
1005615	Third when we see the reasons 1 and 2, they have the same and the most important problem 'the freedom'.	0
1005616	thaks to him, i liked English first time.	0
1005617	There are many reasons.	0
1005618	But he console me several times.	0
1005619	I want to go Africa.	0
1005620	Is that law is really for children?	0
1005621	Therefore, when we want to stop a lot of cyber crimes, people should use their real names on the internet to get responsibility in the cyber world, like in the real world.	0
1005622	Someone talk that we have the right of expressing our opinions and It could be appeared by using fake name.	0
1005623	Then, teachers cannot strictly control students' rude behaviors.	0
1005624	So, they don't play a joke in the internet and make wrong informations	0
1005625	They complain that it is too hard to go to the top of mountain.	0
1005626	To punish children is cruel, however, if punishment is disappeared in school, teacher's right to teach children and organize class's order will be broken down.	0
1005627	My friends whom their mom didn't punish them at the age are not good people.	0
1005628	It is obvious that we need to do experiments with cows to develope the vaccine.	0
1005629	So everybody think i disagree about physical punishment.	0
1005630	they will make a misbehavior.	0
1005631	Physical punishment is very common in Korea houses and schools.	0
1005632	but I think all teacher had better when they give physical punishment they never put feeling on the punishment.	0
1005633	Sure. Any type of Physicaly punishment from smakcing to "Ori gul-um" wich means duck walking in korean shouldn't be allowed in all schools.	0
1005634	However, when drivers are driving their car in a town, It's not that dangerous comparing to fore one.	0
1005635	It have Nowadays relation between two countries is becoming worse since Myeong-bhak LEE became South Korea's president.	0
1005636	If we don't use our real name in the internet, we will write scripts without any responsibility.	0
1005637	According to this, teaching students that they are wrong by physical punishments on their own body is faster than just saying and making rules.	0
1005638	Not all students need the physical punishment, but almost students need the physcial punishment.	0
1005639	Yes, I think so.	0
1005640	If we use it while driving, it will violate our law of sociaty.	0
1005641	There has been many concerns about Internet names.	0
1005642	That day i was very hate the piano.	0
1005643	In this essay, I will show what I think and why I think that way.	0
1005644	second, need objective information this topic.	0
1005645	Second, 'nickname people' can write bad texts or bad replies on the Internet.	0
1005646	For example, a medicine has not only huge good medical effects, but also a few bad medical effects.	0
1005647	Maybe there are smokers, but there are also non-smokers.	0
1005648	I met the chemistry 1 when I was second year and when I become third year, I chose the chemistry 2 because of the happy and fun memory in the chemistery 1 and it was one of the good choices in my high school times.	0
1005649	We can solve all these problem by asking some men to work for military for his life for his own work and pay them great honor and money.	0
1005650	Like you fasten the safety belt during the driving, do not using cellular phone is forgranted to anyone.	0
1005651	but i can learn about what is real family which is cannot forget in my life.	0
1005652	My faborite subject is mathmatics.	0
1005653	If car accident threatens not only life of driver who uses cellular phone but also other drivers` right of being safe, using cellular phone while driving should be banned.	0
1005654	By the campaign, we can change our social mood and it can decrease degree of using cell phone another way.	0
1005655	In words, sometimes few people are accused and criticized by many not known people on the internet.	0
1005656	For safe driving, drivers of automobiles use not only their eyes and legs but also ears and hands.	0
1005657	It's a loss not only to male Koreans but also to Korea.	0
1005658	Foremost, forcing the men to complete the army is an infringe of human right since everyone has a right to decide on his own.	0
1005659	So if smoking is banned, it can help many smokers who are willing to quit smoking but can't because they are addicted to it.	0
1005660	Frankly, Chemistry teacher's attraction is one reason that i love chemistry.	0
1005661	And we are going to be a best friend forever.	0
1005662	Yes, they can be only seen in Turkey.	0
1005663	He uses computer in word typing too.	0
1005664	Some people who have dreamed to defense our country should control military services.	0
1005665	Some studying, a human don't like or kill animals that He or She is received bad things about live.	0
1005666	Some people say that it is dangerous to use cellular phones while driving because he or she must use their hand to grab it.	0
1005667	So it cause many second hand effect like mentioned in upper sentence.	0
1005668	Children are independent human beings who deserve to be treated equally.	0
1005669	Recently, people commited many crimes with others name or created one, because they need not to use their real name.	0
1005670	and he teaches very well.	0
1005671	I like that sports.	0
1005672	So after that I try to not to do something wrong.	0
1005673	The most important thing is before the punishment teacher must recall them why they have to get physical punishment.	0
1005674	However, my best friends waited for me for whole four years.	0
1005675	There are already too many problems such as juvenile crimes or pregnancy or et cetra.	0
1005676	also he has hansome face.	0
1005677	Also the cost and police and can be used for more good things and can make better wellfare for citizens.	0
1005678	For example, when I did a wrong thing in elementary school, I got some physical punishment from my teacher.	0
1005679	but i eagered to receive good score so i tried and tried to be familiar to math subject.	0
1005680	Regulating smoking area doesn't mean threat smoker's right.	0
1005681	She listened her schoolmates thoughtfully and concerned them sincerely.	0
1005682	So both North and South Korea are very nervous about that.	0
1005683	Men are always cold and hungry and tired in Korea's military.	0
1005684	I was always curious about the biggest number and the smallest one, and limitation could be an answer to that curiosity.	0
1005685	I think that to ban smoking is one way to protect many people's health and to reduce the number of smokers.	0
1005686	So it may hurt the freedom of express.	0
1005687	I met him when I entered my high school.	0
1005688	And when it comes to somkers' side, many public buildings have to build more smoking rooms.	0
1005689	Furthermore, because medical experiments using animals is not the perfect way, it is also needed to find other ways.	0
1005690	But If we ban smoking in all public buildings, Many smokers would be deny that situation and break the rule for thier life.	0
1005691	And the second, my best friends give me comport.	0
1005692	So I studied one year more and admitted Yonsei University.	0
1005693	We can not be used human in experiments.	0
1005694	Hence, I agee to use real name on the Internet.	0
1005695	First, I loved to learning English itself.	0
1005696	Secondly, nowdays there are many programs to make fake name and fake ID numbers.	0
1005697	By using our own nickname, we can describe our character freely.	0
1005698	For these reasons, I think smoking should be banned in all public buildings.	0
1005699	They notice voice in phones, so they can't understand easy their cituations.	0
1005700	Finally, if I go to America, I can speak with foreign people.	0
1005701	And that advantages can appear when we don't use our real name on the Intenet.	0
1005702	In information-based societies, it is most important to preserve thier privacy.	0
1005703	If we make all the young men in the country serve for army, it would be a total disaster.	0
1005704	But I think the time when Korean men should be complete in military service is so long that when they back society, they must have some problems in their life First, when they back society from military, they have to study again what they already studied.	0
1005705	I like best go to the country is U.S.A If I have a chance to travel U.S.A and French is I am happy.	0
1005706	Genre is changed but I still love music.	0
1005707	Being in groups, we could easily give advice to each other and learn from others.	0
1005708	Physical punishnent must not be allowed in all schools.	0
1005709	If we permit the punishment, sometimes teachers can not control their students.	0
1005710	that makes other's feeling bad.	0
1005711	Such as Cooperation with others and showing respect to other people.	0
1005712	Actually, I did not like the geography subject, but there was a impressive episode that made me consider him as the best teacher.	0
1005713	But very impressing and nice thing is not that.	0
1005714	One who fluently speaks English, he can serve as Katusa helping Amerecan army.	0
1005715	I think the physical punishment is necessary.	0
1005716	This is because it is very helpful to all schools and time-efficient.	0
1005717	We are not so special but we trust each other and any time we can give help the other.	0
1005718	Some people says it is unfare to men.	0
1005719	A friend of mine did a terrible things like playing with his teacher, smoking in the school and so on.	0
1005720	When everybody is tired and bored to do something, my best friend wants to do that and always participate in every activities.	0
1005721	I argue that people shoud not be allowed to use celluar phones while driving.	0
1005722	Of course, stop smoking is very difficult.	0
1005723	Their opinions are right.	0
1005724	He have told me that he said to her mom that "Good night, Mom" but next morning she's dead.	0
1005725	This way of punishment cause more resist for student to teachers and school.	0
1005726	The nation have to prevent no peolple doing crime by early control.	0
1005727	first, some argue that not using real name can make people attack others more easily because they think they don't have to show up.	0
1005728	If a driver use his cellular phone, he or her doesn't watch front.	0
1005729	Even if I don't look like movie star, I love myself, itself.	0
1005730	For serious example, if the pragnant woman in some public buildings get unwanted smoking fogs and a baby in her body become dead because of smoking, the pragnant woman infringe on her rights and can't reward anything for the dead baby.	0
1005731	And then I go to home.	0
1005732	Not much but Whenever I see my bank account, I'm really happy.	0
1005733	thes, it using many people.	0
1005734	He also was our homeroom teacher.	0
1005735	Third, Drivers who make accident can go to jail.	0
1005736	My best friend is my roommate in my high school.	0
1005737	And if such smoking is in public buildings, where is used for pubilc formal work, so can be visited by any of citizen, it definitely be 'public enemy'.	0
1005738	But I think having strong military force has nothing to do with mandatory military service.	0
1005739	The loser should drink a cup of mixed alchoal.	0
1005740	All my saturdays are busy.	0
1005741	However, sadly I soon came to the limit of my ability.	0
1005742	I've heard that the night sky there has some fantastic views of the stars.	0
1005743	Many Korean men who sould complete military service do not want go the military because of the time burden.	0
1005744	these thinks are very dangerous.	0
1005745	I don't agree that question.	0
1005746	So, if we allow the use of cellular phones while driving, it must be a problem like accidient which can be killed.	0
1005747	They are so different food in Korea.	0
1005748	so in Washington or in NewYork were skyline shaped by many of huge buildings.	0
1005749	To sum up, to protect students' basic rights, psychological health and of course health of the society as a whole, it is fairly enough to say that physical punishment should not be allowed in schools.	0
1005750	Fourth, If we use our real name, we can communicate with other people more carefully.	0
1005751	However, when it comes to animals, case is different.	0
1005752	So we must not give up finding another way to replace animal experiments.	0
1005753	Second, it can be constraints.	0
1005754	Drivers need and should have lots of attention at his/her driving.	0
1005755	Other reason is that i want to experience other countries' culture.	0
1005756	In these days, people in the medical science use the animal to get a good medicine to extend human's live.	0
1005757	But the problem was not that.	0
1005758	Smoke smell is disgust and causes coach to non-smoker, so non-smoker has a stress with smoke.	0
1005759	People's mind are set up to good manners.	0
1005760	At this time, to whom you can blame.	0
1005761	First of all, nowdays many people use bad word and slang because other people don't know who say that word.	0
1005762	At firtst, I think computer because that was a seed of problem when i'm young boy and that begin a helper at highscool study.	0
1005763	Therefore it is crucial to keep it from being totally naked.	0
1005764	I'll keep writing it until my last day.	0
1005765	In this context, the policy for military service gives a person a chance to contribute.	0
1005766	They take a shock who read words are harmful about themselves so are taken care of by counselors to protect their suicides.	0
1005767	Different from Japan, China has big scale of things : tall buildings, 2-story buses, Tian An Men, and The Great Wall.	0
1005768	they misuse the point of Internet.	0
1005769	Of course, physical punishment is restricted.	0
1005770	So if we discuss continuously about the alternatives, we can make a very positive solution which can make consensus among all the people.	0
1005771	The feeling of aches is a powerful way to teach young student.	0
1005772	My grandmother is in the hospital because she is so sick.	0
1005773	She corrected our misbehaviors indirectly by telling stories related to famous people's wrong actions.	0
1005774	Of coure I started helping mom, and became owner too.	0
1005775	But secret gives us something that "Um. other people never know this text is my thinking.	0
1005776	Even though it's really difficult to memorize how to write and read (since every character has ups and downs), learning the hidden structure was academically meaningful.	0
1005777	So I think only the person who wants to go to army should complete military service.	0
1005778	If men are not forced to go military service, US army alone goes to war against The North Korea, it doesn't make sense and we will probably be defeated the battle somehow.	0
1005779	I studied Math a lot when I was in middle school.	0
1005780	My best friend always study hard and do the exercise every day.	0
1005781	For a long time, people act like they don't think about it.	0

1005783	And i wanted to study more about physics in university.	0
1005784	Also, basic understanding of using weapons is mandatory in case of the worst situation that can happen.	0

1005787	Sometimes we played online game in PC room.	0
1005788	First, Internet is a open space.	0
1005789	My favorite teacher in high school is Lee Jung Joo.	0
1005790	When I was young, I wait for my friends in buildings,but one person smoked so hard.	0
1005791	First, Japan is center of fashion.	0

1005796	I don't think there are.	0
1005797	I usually spend time with my friend.	0
1005798	So I asked her to help me.	0
1005799	On the other nand, social networks, like Twitter and Facebook, which is popular these days, are good example of sound communication on the net.	0
1005800	Student feel their teacher lost power when teacher doesn't punish them and think their teacher easily.	0
1005801	It is the reason of no specific criteria.	0
1005802	They give us some rest and fun.	0
1005803	This situation is just like driving.	0
1005804	So we studied in the same study room one more year.	0
1005805	There is no reason for us to be forced to comlete military service.	0
1005806	For many years, my opinion had been 'Yes' to this question until I listened a news that speaks out that students are too impolite nowadays.	0
1005807	I read it a lot at books, watched it a lot at news and saw a lot of adults who dislike Japan.	0
1005808	This fogs are harm many people, because fogs are gas.	0
1005809	I think physical punishment shouldn't be allowed in all schools.	0
1005810	Of cause smokers' 'smoking right' is also right.	0
1005811	Therefore talking to the phone while driving is not socially acceptable so it should be banned.	0
1005812	However, Ji-Hoon kindly helped me settle and have a satisfying school life ever since.	0
1005813	We can't skip that problem.	0
1005814	It make me more generous and heartful.	0
1005815	In addition, middle school student teacher hit student cheek and kick so the student go to the hospitol and was healed.	0
1005816	So i like this picture a lot, and it is my most valuable thing in my possesion.	0
1005817	It has many exciting saying and I think this is Korean's most fine advantages.	0
1005818	Teacher is worker that makes part make society.	0
1005819	"but you know, even people who experince accident think same like you.	0
1005820	He's name is Kim Hunsik.	0
1005821	The people who agree with this opinion think that human being is the most precious creature in the universe.	0
1005822	Nuclear are very dangerous.	0
1005823	So it was the best time for me to meet students who will study other major in University.	0
1005824	But When I was 15, I had to send her to my grandmother.	0
1005825	There will be more reasons that I can't find.	0
1005826	In my opinion, true taechers don't need physical punishment to control students and to lead them for their goal of life.	0
1005827	Teachers must educate in words first, and when they need physical punishmet in their judges, they can do it.	0
1005828	He had gone back England when we graduated, but we remember him.	0
1005829	So I think there are lots of things to learn in such a highly developed country, United States.	0
1005830	People say that we must use real name on the internet, because there are many bad reply on the internet in which we can use our nickname.	0
1005831	Many people will be surprised after knowing that parts of some particular animals' bodies are very similar to human's ones.	0
1005832	Also, Internet is a public area.	0
1005833	So whenever driver needs a phone call, don't using a cell phone while driving is better than getting a car accident.	0
1005834	he used to have talk with students when he have freetime.	0
1005835	There are a song machine and MICs so we sang many songs alnight.	0
1005836	Then, real society is affected, too.	0
1005837	However, it is virtually impossible.	0
1005838	I disagree that people must use their real name on the Internet.	0
1005839	i often watch movies, hellow ghost of movies.	0
1005840	After 30 years, Old population very increase, This phenemon helps many things.	0
1005841	There are many heartwarming stories and the characters in Korean literature are similar with Korean people, like me.	0
1005842	I think that physical punishment should be allowed in all schools.	0
1005843	Physical punishment is a very controvertial issue in Korea.	0
1005844	I did all things that i can do.	0
1005845	Finally, I think one person cannot physically punish another person, even if it's about teacher-student relationship.	0
1005846	Finally, the physical punishment of student give the worst thing to students, teachers, schools and society.	0
1005847	When one smokes the smoke spreads in the air and be breathed in to non smokers lung.	0
1005848	Drivers have to think their live more important and have to think about their famillies.	0
1005849	In the people, some are smokers and the others are non-smokers.	0
1005850	I usually meet him and talks about my high school life I tooked.	0
1005851	So there are no rights for the smokers to hurt innocent non-smokers' lungs.	0
1005852	The reason i think he is my best teacher is that he is very kind to every student, and he always teaching very passionable.	0
1005853	Consequently, my best friend's kindness make me happy and our friendship last forever.	0
1005854	But i want to say them that we can earn things more than lost things.	0
1005855	He helped a lot in enterance exam and he loved me.	0
1005856	I always think that I want to protect them not to be used in experiments that ignored their lives.	0
1005857	so i agree with our government law that drivers of automobiles not be alowed to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1005858	it's economy and culture affect Korea directly.	0
1005859	Of course I like other members of the team.	0
1005860	We also need to think about the other animals in the future or in other places and the power which can save more people.	0
1005861	I think my phone has special meaning for me.	0
1005862	Playing with him, I don't have to watch time because of being bored.	0
1005863	There might be older people, women who are pregnant, and also, as I mentioned, children.	0
1005864	Now, I can study very well and my family continue happy and I have a lot of friend.	0
1005865	Morever, because almost drivers use a hand to take a call, if they have some dangerous omen, they may be not able to response in right time.	0
1005866	After that, I do some school projects.	0
1005867	So, instead, the room for only smoking people should be made.	0
1005868	I did bad things to get attention.	0
1005869	I always been thank to her even when I graduated.	0
1005870	We must recognize that we humans are also animal.	0
1005871	I liked literature the most.	0
1005872	So he always tell us really funny stories.	0
1005873	So, Korean men should go to the army to complete military service and keep their nation's security.	0
1005874	If student who have had a problem go to DaeAn school, he would come back to our society by taking property that occur the problem.	0
1005875	People, for example, show their names and even faces in class presentation.	0
1005876	In addition, Egypt consists of desert which is very popular all over the world.	0
1005877	building can make smoking area for smoking people, and make that area in the passing by wind place.	0
1005878	The first reason is that if you don't use the real name, you feel like there are no people watching the 'real' you in the 'real' world, and that makes it much more easier to attack people in the cyber space, or do some things that is illegal.	0
1005879	So, by last solution, physical punishment should be left.	0
1005880	I don't think that radical change can change the smoker's urge.	0
1005881	The cap is what my girlfriend gived me in our anniversary.	0
1005882	For example, there are new wind of contents creation called user created contents which are full of creative than ever.	0
1005883	Since breaking some rules in school often results in terrible accidents, teachers cannot help punishing students physically to keep them safe.	0
1005884	But when i was young, when my parents went out, It cheered me up and made me not lonely.	0
1005885	for example, busy business man can use cellular phone for phone banking while driving.	0
1005886	The algorism is simple.	0
1005887	If teachers free about physical punishment problems, It can be taken a place that inocent students are punished by teachers.	0
1005888	And man is capable of doing this.	0
1005889	There is a lot of other effective solution.	0
1005890	To solve this arguments and make decision, we must think about big ficture, not about small picture.	0
1005891	It is my first love.	0
1005892	He was English teacher and my homeroom teacher.	0
1005893	so i agree that all men should me forced to complete military service to protect our nation Korea.	0
1005894	And he will not use his real name on the Internet.	0
1005895	i like that responsible activity of him.	0
1005896	Like this using animals on medical experiment can devote to whole this world.	0
1005897	Suppose that something that more powerful tham us uses us as tools of medical experiment.	0
1005898	At first, I liked him because he looked very similiar to my favorite celebrity.	0
1005899	Of course, there must be the rule that exhibit the abuse, and unnessecery experiments.	0
1005900	Third reason is that if there is no respect, maybe students don't learn many things from teacher except knowledges.	0
1005901	That's the reason I bought Invincible2.	0
1005902	Because his job is navy.	0
1005903	I agree that people should use real name on the internet.	0
1005904	so when i hang out with her, that day would become an very energetic.	0
1005905	I traveled many attraction sites of Beijing, talking with my father.	0
1005906	And they usually thought that physical punishment was more effective than talking to solve this problem.	0
1005907	some smokers don't sorry to nonsmoker who near them.	0
1005908	Goverment should know that people's thought on the internet is very good to solve nation problem.	0
1005909	I'll study about electrons or electricity in univeristy.	0
1005910	the starcraft game converted my view to everything.	0
1005911	But the number of those is too small.	0
1005912	But who knows?	0
1005913	This is really great time for me because I can talk about film with her after watching movie.	0
1005914	I think the cause of the defied teacher by student is that the teachers don't punish their students in school, so they are thought powerless by students.	0
1005915	I heard that the raw exist for the weak not for the power.	0
1005916	First of all, we should protect the rights of people who don't smoke.	0
1005917	"It is true.	0
1005918	I think this hobby helped me a lot.	0
1005919	We should make a act like that for preventing problems.	0
1005920	Schools have their own rules.	0
1005921	However, I disagree that people should be obligaged to use real names online for following reasons.	0
1005922	He is lazy, but he knows what he has to do.	0
1005923	it is wasteful for our society to clean the yellow in building and we must leave our healthy habit to out kids.	0
1005924	I prefer movie to drama because movie is shorter than drama, and movie have more thrill than drama.	0
1005925	My favorite teacher is spanish teacher of my high school.	0
1005926	So clearing cost is very high.	0
1005927	There are some reasons why.	0
1005928	Doctors found the reason of her death and that is because of her husband.	0
1005929	Sometimes I meet my freinds.	0
1005930	Near the my high school there is a youth center.	0
1005931	Students are to be adults should be aware of this fact.	0
1005932	If we don't physical punishment of children, children don't follow teacher's order.	0
1005933	Usually I play basketball at Saturday.	0
1005934	And that physical punishment is not good for chidren.	0
1005935	I disagree with the physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1005936	In every situation, violence must be avoided if it seems to be the only way.	0
1005937	Because of medical treat, human can live longer and live healthier.	0
1005938	Second, I worked part-time job.	0
1005939	First, smoking has a negative impact on air of the area which a smoker is in, and as a result of this, air pollution in a small area can be caused by smoking.	0
1005940	First, I want to talk with other human races, and get along with them.	0
1005941	Unlike humans, there is no way to compensate animals for being used in the experiments.	0
1005942	If someone smoking in public buildings, that will affect other people's health.	0
1005943	When I walked the street, some people smoke in public places.	0
1005944	People contact an illness and sometimes very serious as they could be die.	0
1005945	But we can't do experiments using people, so we should use animals to do experiments.	0
1005946	When we meet, we usually go to the cafe.	0
1005947	There is a problem of using real name too.	0
1005948	I was not good at chinese.	0
1005949	Academical knowledges in science always refreshed me.	0
1005950	Personally, I agree with this for two reasons.	0
1005951	Then I come home and take a rest for a while.	0
1005952	Therefore, drivers of automobiles should not be allowed to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1005953	there is two reason that smoking should be banned in public building or place.	0
1005954	It is very economic and safe.	0
1005955	Children don't liscen to what the teacher says.	0
1005956	It can more harmful to drivers.	0
1005957	He is a heavy smoker.	0
1005958	so women should also go military to be fair.	0
1005959	It should be changed.	0
1005960	But human is more valuable than animals.	0
1005961	Because the special opportunities are given only few men.	0
1005962	Those people who agree this existing military system would worry about war so that we have to have enough army to fight against.	0
1005963	Because many car drivers still use cell phone.	0
1005964	On that day my family going out dinner celebrating my entrance.	0
1005965	But in my opinion, using cell phones on the road can be very dangerous.	0
1005966	Why they should suffer from medicine because of people?	0
1005967	We are living here together.	0
1005968	As a comtemporary person in morden life, cellular phones are important and unique, but we can use it in another time.	0
1005969	For example, U.S.A.'s physical punishment is allowed in country low.	0
1005970	The fog of cigarette can contaminate the air of public buildings.	0
1005971	Why do smokers aparthaid?	0
1005972	The bill that uses real names is necessary for sober people who posted their thoughts about some subjects and their human rights.	0
1005973	Some people kill bears, snakes, deers, even monkeys for their health.	0
1005974	It's just irony, not justice or mortal.	0
1005975	It induces headache or even fatigue to young or week person.	0
1005976	Because people think that if they write critical things about powerful person, he or she must hurt them.	0
1005977	To get that much advantages, you should go millitary and complete.	0
1005978	It is a good thing to teach them not to fight each other.	0
1005979	It is thing we can only do.	0
1005980	So in this case, teachers should give the physical punishment.	0
1005981	So Government substract the number of soldiers and the invest the money to improve the technology of Military.	0
1005982	First, it is danger to use cellular phone while driving.	0
1005983	My favorit teacher in my high school was the teacher who tought us German language.	0
1005984	Second, south korea is not that rich.	0
1005985	and i take this cube some days, it is perpect one.	0
1005986	i have i phone.	0
1005987	many teachers use sticks to punish students physically.	0
1005988	But I think just being told is not enough.	0
1005989	His outgoing makes every people smile.	0
1005990	As a result, teachers feel powerless and don't eager to teach students.	0
1005991	As Spanish teacher, he had been to many spanish speaking countries; most of the countries in the Latin America and many regions in Spain.	0
1005992	I want to visit Japan, meet Japanese people, speak in Japanese, and experience the culture of Japan.	0
1005993	And then, in point of amount of knowledge, we will get very small amount of knowledge compared to opposite situation.	0
1005994	Because of developing, it pollutes air, water, earth and nature and it hurts or makes animals die.	0
1005995	Nowadays I began joining new studying club.	0
1005996	But using a cell phone while driving is cause a lot danger of car accident.	0
1005997	But, Is Physical Punishment really effective to leading the student?	0
1005998	But We live with other people.	0
1005999	If science is developed a lot we can get rid of the experiments.	0
1006000	Does a teacher have to use the physical punishment to make his or her students follow to classes?	0
1006001	Second, real name policy can be bad effect to private life.	0
1006002	If I go to japan, I talk about our problems with Japanese and get a solution.	0
1006003	They satisfied it too.	0
1006004	Those pictures are really scary.	0
1006005	They still can smoke outside the building and satisfy more comparing to smoking in the building since they don't have to worry whether they are disturbing other people or not.	0
1006006	And from school to home, elastic relationship is made, teacher should warn trouble chilren's parents.	0
1006007	Elemantary school students are afraid of teacher because they are young.	0
1006008	Animals do what the trainer wants because they don't want to get hit.	0
1006009	Opinions might be divided over whether the physical punishment should be done to children in school.	0
1006010	We have to be careful when we meet person that we have never seen before in cyberspace.	0
1006011	After funny daytime, at night, I and 8 friends got together to make fun of one friend like a TV show.	0
1006012	I think physical punishment should not be allowed in all schools.	0
1006013	I will visit the city when I am in Japan.	0
1006014	So they say many rumors to stars beacase they need not to have responsibility.	0
1006015	Also art teacher was my homeroom teacher in high school.	0
1006016	According to an economic article, people tend to keep their money with no guarantee rather than earn money with high risk.	0
1006017	In the perspective of public good, smoking has only harmful effect to smoker and therefore, to the whole society.	0
1006018	I have special friend who had been three years at high school.	0
1006019	if a student does a bad thing such as bully a friend or use a bad word, they get a one red card.	0
1006020	From this behavior, the trash can is firing.	0
1006021	Not forcing one person to complete military service, and just let them do their job would bring increased satisfaction to that group of people.	0
1006022	Thus, in these reasons, I forcely suggest that using real name on the Internet is activated.	0
1006023	Even now I really feel grateful for him to let me know how to live a life happily.	0
1006024	It is a right of children to be educated to behave appropriately so that they can become a good citizen.	0
1006025	So, with two reasons I wrote above, I strongly disagrees with the physical punishment done in schools.	0
1006026	It contains plenty of pictures, which include our cherish momeries.	0
1006027	Therefore, drivers who are apt to drive may not have difficulty about low attention during driving.	0
1006028	Someone who drives must concentrates on only one thing, driving.	0
1006029	We don't have the method to monitering each teachers.	0
1006030	Because of reasons I suggested above, I want to go Italy.	0
1006031	teachers have the power to lead their students to their dream.	0
1006032	And I like the japan moive very much.	0
1006033	This book can be astonishing although many times it turned out to be boring.	0
1006034	As grade is important thing for admission to the university education, student will obey to school rules with physical pain.	0
1006035	In military, they are always acted by their seniors.	0
1006036	It means scientists don't have authority to use loved pets which oppositon group argue.	0
1006037	Therefore children still cannot understand the bad point of his/her behavior and do not try to change the bad behavior by himself/herself.	0
1006038	Countless accidents occur in schools everyday, and these were broadcasted in news.	0
1006039	First of all, physcal punishment cannot change student's mind.	0
1006040	and the nation fall in rude, dark, carzy forest.	0
1006041	Trauma which physical punishment caused can be a invisible hurdle in communications because the trauma may interfere with chains of thinking.	0
1006042	Men are stronger than women in physical ground.	0
1006043	the interesting thing that happened to me in the past vacation is that going to Busan in winter.	0
1006044	but on the contrary He had warm heart, sincely thought about students, and worried about students acting unproperly.	0
1006045	In serving a military service, I think there is not one way, going to army and being a soldier, to complete duty.	0
1006046	First, in that class, my teacher taught how to read literature.	0
1006047	After that, I usually go to some popular shopping streets in Korea with my friends.	0
1006048	so Korean men should complete military service.	0
1006049	My favorite teacher was my first-grade classroom teacher.	0
1006050	I was too young to understand my parent's mind considering my futher I just had played on-line games to have a strong charicter and few years later i noticed my parent's mind so i have stared study to go university.	0
1006051	Just obey and punish.	0
1006052	First of all, Singapore is very welly-developed country in Asia.	0
1006053	However when I surf the Internet site, I see bad words easily.	0
1006054	we need experiment, but we can't use human easily.	0
1006055	I love plants and animals.	0
1006056	Do you think killing a person is right?	0
1006057	so for posing differation on online and real world, we don't have to use our real name on the internet.	0
1006058	For example, see a movie, go to a park for walking and go to a cafe for talking.	0
1006059	However those car accidents are not caused someone using the cellular phone to telephoning with the other person.	0
1006060	First we can't stop medical experiments.	0
1006061	So using animals in medical experiment can be justified by roll of nature.	0
1006062	I also think that we need the law about these bad actings on the Internet, and the cyber cops who catch the Internet criminals and punish them.	0
1006063	Teaching students to have right thought is more important than teaching them to not act badly because the latter one is a temporary solution.	0
1006064	I am a man after two years should go to military.	0
1006065	However children had not submitted this nullification, school make them to well their hair style by means of the physical punishment.	0
1006066	His great interview was very impressive to me.	0
1006067	Although unity is the best alternative, above all for only essential men are in army government should make policies regarding military problem.	0
1006068	they cant not controll without punishment.	0
1006069	We are the members of High School.	0
1006070	The answer is, reasonable, proper action.	0
1006071	You must know about the fact.	0
1006072	Moreover, forcing some talented people to fufill military service is wasting their talents.	0
1006073	I have some exmaples.	0
1006074	To begin with, there is no proper way to control some bad students without physical punishement.	0
1006075	However I thinkg human-being's safety is the first thing that we must have in mind.	0
1006076	Then suddenly, someone screamed loudly.	0
1006077	So, as a being, the value of human and that of none-human creature are equal.	0
1006078	He takes care of it with his great effort.	0
1006079	However, when I asked just one question, "Do you know how can we get there?", she could not think about driving and answer at a same time, so she could not see a traffic light.	0
1006080	However, military work is better fitting to men, rather than women, physically and environmentally.	0
1006081	althout i don`t remember the name of disease, i`m encouraged by a person who has a disease.	0
1006082	Because middle school students are adolescents, they are very rude and sometimes they even ridicule thier teachers.	0
1006083	If we ban smoking in all public buildings, we should make a smoking room in private buildings for somkers.	0
1006084	So tru stories are concealed for many people.	0
1006085	There are several reasons for that.	0
1006086	I have been there last year, and I liked the people and the sight of there.	0
1006087	In most cases teachers are parents, but nowdays, some parents are so busy that they don't take care of their children, or only child.	0
1006088	Finally, smoking causes hygienic problems in public buildings.	0
1006089	More than often, physical punishment just stimulates troublesome students' anger rather than changing them to the more responsible ones.	0
1006090	But after we graduate, she leave our city and go back to her family's home in Busan.	0
1006091	Many people easily write malicious comments, which can be a big hurt to someone.	0
1006092	while we ate traditional Maori's food, Maori's man danced their taditional dancing.	0
1006093	I was very close to her, and we had a great time at New York.	0
1006094	Until yesterday, i had been a high school student.	0
1006095	Second, the statics of accident that using cellular phones while driving is more and more increasing.	0
1006096	Physcial punishments must be limited for general schools.	0
1006097	Others who have a many money are to give many money to goverment that is need to military service.	0
1006098	For example, rabbit pregnant 5 to 10 babies at once while human pregnant only one.	0
1006099	I think earth science is the most attractive subject.	0
1006100	They are not stronger than their middle school or high school male students.	0
1006101	If someone wants to smoke whithout any harm to other people, we can't restrict him because smoking is just his favor.	0
1006102	It has a reasons that we have used animals in medical experiments.	0
1006103	When I see it, I always remind its meaning.	0
1006104	Korean Literature has some kind of different feeling from Western Literature.	0
1006105	for example, i have yonger brother.	0
1006106	So we should enhance our force of military.	0
1006107	But in real world it might not.	0
1006108	That's safe and better because you can concentrate on just one thing.	0
1006109	Punishment in school should not be allowed.	0
1006110	In particulary, the smoking smell is like poison to non-smokers.	0
1006111	Students who had be punished understand that at about 20 years old.	0
1006112	So, i thought that totally none physical punishment is not effective.	0
1006113	Before talk, After punishment is reasonable.	0
1006114	For these years, women that don't need to have any military responsibilities can develop individuals for their jobs and go on their studies.	0
1006115	So young men lose their fresh 2 years in their life.	0
1006116	On the internet they are making some unbelievable gossips and giving some hurts to other people.	0
1006117	I wanted this surgery since I was a elementary school student.	0
1006118	I live in daegu so I went to Busan and got on the ship to Jeju.	0
1006119	There is something that has been possessed members of a family.	0
1006120	The best case is that no student hurts to physical punishment.	0
1006121	If he calls with many people, speaking time can be long.	0
1006122	It seemed that there were no problems.	0
1006123	My mother was strict more to my sister than to me because she is older sister.	0
1006124	In a TV program, I saw that the France people is cleaning their area which is in front of their house's door.	0
1006125	They looked bad because of cigarettes on the street.	0
1006126	So I did my best in P.E. class.	0
1006127	When I was hit, I didn't felt guilty, but upset.	0
1006128	But I don't agree with the full use of the cell phone.	0
1006129	People are not guilty what they say.	0
1006130	who will save our country?	0
1006131	From now on, i expect every day to be enjoyable, especially saturda.	0
1006132	These days, cellular phone is very important things for social network.	0
1006133	And as time goes and goes, advanced unit was preyed by more advanced unit.	0
1006134	Sometimes they lose all.	0
1006135	The physical punishment have an effect that lead the children in the good way.	0
1006136	I can't disagree with that opinion.	0
1006137	I like to go to France. becaues France is famous about building design.	0
1006138	In this time, I want to go to beach in Hutkaido, univercial studio in Osaka and Dokyo.	0
1006139	For bigger goals, for wider plans, we use animals like rats.	0
1006140	During 1960 to 1990, there were absolute crossline between the activities of man and woman.	0
1006141	Last, with that regulations and machins, we must announce about dangers and protect people from car accidents.	0
1006142	We ourselves booked our house and we planned it all by ourselvs.	0
1006143	Stresses can ruin or harm people's health.	0
1006144	No !	0
1006145	but If I am in this situation.	0
1006146	Matter of freedom, and of economy.	0
1006147	Additionaly, Austrailia is large.	0
1006148	whatever!	0
1006149	So we can study with fun.	0
1006150	That law protects students from teacher's physical punishment.	0
1006151	But If I have a chance to choose, I would choose human's life.	0
1006152	I usually spend my Saturday with my family.	0
1006153	Although the education without physical punishment can be inefficient, it is the ultimate education that we should achieve.	0
1006154	when thinking on student's side, it is easy to be against the rule when physically punished.	0
1006155	But different from any other teachers, He sympathied me and encouraged to find the places where I took around.	0
1006156	he likes singing and I do too.	0
1006157	And I went Japan last year, so I can travel Japan more easily next time.	0
1006158	Violence in school that is widely accepted by society can make a fright in young children's mind, and make them be outsider.	0
1006159	Like this case there is limit in just warning and scolding.	0
1006160	Our music teacher tought various types of musics such as classic, pop, jazz, and even famous songs from opera.	0
1006161	Thesedays a lot of parents are worried about their children becuase of physical punishment in schools.	0
1006162	So I think that physical punishment can be allowed in some cases.	0
1006163	we didn't communicate well with people that live in Japan. but, we have a very good time.	0
1006164	However, several months later, the side-effect of the drug began to appear, and many newly born children from women who used the drug while they were pregnant became disabled in both physically and mentally.	0
1006165	Also, popular teacher and sport star are the same.	0
1006166	There are three reasons.	0
1006167	Philosophy can help poeple live their life and polish their quality of life.	0
1006168	I sometimes go shopping with my brother caues he want my help.	0
1006169	Secondly, he is caring.	0
1006170	But, the punishment is unfair.	0
1006171	There are two big reasons I like her very much.	0
1006172	In my oppinion, I strongly believe that all Korean men should serve military duties.	0
1006173	my house is in the Chungju and my boyfriend's house is in the SEOUL so I have to go bus tuminal this is very annoying.	0
1006174	I can learn about new culture and meet many different people.	0
1006175	Also i want to enjoy Hutkaido snow party.	0
1006176	So human shouldn't have animal's life.	0
1006177	I liked mathematics best in high school.	0
1006178	To teach them these society roles schools have to use punishment.	0
1006179	I strongly agree on idea that peple must use their real name on the internet because there are a lot of problems on the internet without people's real name.	0
1006180	before i arrived jeju island, i was very nervous because it was first time to have a trip alone.	0
1006181	If physcal punishment is allowed in schools again, teachers can controll and teach students more easilly, and sutdents no more	0
1006182	Of course, there are disadvantages in using real name on the Internet.	0
1006183	Then we will have many smokers who hurt not only themselves but also other people.	0
1006184	celluar phone is now people's essential part of living daily life.	0
1006185	When people say their opinion freely and adjust their opnion, democracy will develop.	0
1006186	The biggest problem is it makes student rudely.	0
1006187	That is the only legacy that my grand father left to me.	0
1006188	Using our own name can make other serious problem that private information is opened used in bad ways.	0
1006189	They think that animal's right to live must be equelized with human right because both are same unit.	0
1006190	the people shouldn't hurt because of some of people.	0
1006191	The other is Indirect smoke.	0
1006192	On the internet, there are so many informations that are very useful.	0
1006193	Third, military power is same as our nation's power.	0
1006194	Usually people concentrate their phone when they talk on phone.	0
1006195	But some people speak to me that I after go to military I will becomming stupid.	0
1006196	And I think that the physical punishment always not mean very hard physical bad doing.	0
1006197	When I play team sports in PE class.	0
1006198	On Saturday, I usually do three things: going to PC room with my high school friends, watching a TV drama or movie, and last, sleeping.	0
1006199	My favorite teacher was my Korean teacher.	0
1006200	But I saw a black large car near him, then I notice him.	0
1006201	Furthermore, websites like Nate in Korea is not allowed to use fake names on their web but still problems that are written above occurs, which proves that it is not the real name that we need but the education of responsibility.	0
1006202	I ususlly play soccer in saturdays.	0
1006203	I feel free when I'm hitting mosters on screen and I release my stress.	0
1006204	You have to watch other automobiles and people walking on the side.	0
1006205	I admit that smokers should be provided the place to smoke.	0
1006206	In Korea, most teachers, especially olds, think they can punish students with physical movement when students are guilty.	0
1006207	The reason i like my best friend most is active.	0
1006208	Yes, l agree.	0
1006209	They hide and hide to smoke, and finally the difficulty of controlling the smoker gets higher.	0
1006210	And when one of family has some bad think, we talk with him and he will get better.	0
1006211	This is very important point.	0
1006212	We talked about what to buy, what to eat and where to go after shopping.	0
1006213	In this problems, Stoping physical punishment is terrible and Accepting physical punishment always is terrible, too.	0
1006214	I live in seoul with my friends.	0
1006215	If physical punishments are prohibitted in schools, students may be happy that they do not get hit and so behave rude to teachers.	0
1006216	In Europe, I have been told that their schools don't allow their teachers to take physical punishment to their students.	0
1006217	But I did not say all schoos.	0
1006218	Then, one of the biggest problem in Korea can be solved, and we can make more healthy society.	0
1006219	So, they no have reasons that cannot complete military service.	0
1006220	It's a great blessing I ever had.	0
1006221	People should consider that animals have feelings just like humans.	0
1006222	For example, when one user read some bad sentences from other users, he or she have many bad feelings.	0
1006223	There are some reason why I agree with the physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1006224	We can have better internet culture by using real name.	0
1006225	But the student does again and again.	0
1006226	Swimming is an effective way to exercise my body and release my stress.	0
1006227	When a pregnant woman smokes (or have a enviroment where people smokes) it is very likely to the baby being handicapped or not smart.	0
1006228	this ring means 'good luck to you'and 'we always love you.	0
1006229	but some teachers insist teacher could attack students because it's education.	0
1006230	And If I go to the state of liberty, I want to check that's real size with eyes.	0
1006231	It increase qualiy of my life and I can enjoy the literatures through this education.	0
1006232	The environment for good education will be ready.	0
1006233	First of all, Indirect smoke, It is a disaster to our health.	0
1006234	If some people do crime on the Internet, we can get them more easily.	0
1006235	Since when I was 13 years old, I wanted to study chemistry.	0
1006236	So if smoking is permitted in public buildings, many innocent people will be harmed and suffer from illness.	0
1006237	Phisics and mathematics was somewhat difficult for me because I had to memorize many formulas and think many different ways to solve problems.	0
1006238	In fact, there is a site already doing that thing.	0
1006239	but middle school can not middle shcool student is many confilct occur now so in middle school, physical punishment is important for student controlling.	0
1006240	I think smoking should be banned in public buildings.	0
1006241	Above reasons show how dangerous it could be when talking on the phone while driving.	0
1006242	I don't think that all Korean men should be forced to complete millitary service.	0
1006243	We have to clean the earth.	0
1006244	We know the only one planet where the creature lives.	0
1006245	So they make many Internet communities where they can express and share their feelings in more comfortable mood.	0
1006246	but for senior citizens, they have own rights to select their decision too.	0
1006247	Although the interests about the class may be effected by the teacher but generally I find it most fun.	0
1006248	But, there is value which is prior to smokers' rights to smoke.	0
1006249	So public buildings have to make smoking room.	0
1006250	I know there is a reverse opinion that because human's life is important, so animal's life is not different.	0
1006251	Almost everyone in Korea has memory of physical punishment in basic(elementary, middle, high) school.	0
1006252	I play soccer with my brother at early morning.	0
1006253	and this time was winter vacation.	0
1006254	It is very impressing to me.	0
1006255	And this situation gives more study time to me.	0
1006256	He gave me that letter almost 3 years ago but still now I have this in my purse.	0
1006257	From this cause, the Internet culture has bad problem.	0
1006258	In Korea, all people are force to complete military service while in countries like US and England, it is voluntary for people to choose whether to serve military or not.	0
1006259	Who could pay for their loss if driver didn't get a call since it is a forbidden thing, and the call was from a important client?	0
1006260	so I like math.	0
1006261	When I see these photos, I think I should study hard for them.	0
1006262	therefore we don't have to use our real name.	0
1006263	I think.	0
1006264	In my opinion, smoking should be banned in all public buildings.	0
1006265	If everyone has different names, it will be good way to prevent Internet crime.	0
1006266	If their teacher punish them, Their feeling are fastly changed bad.	0
1006267	it cause me inspiring to study hard.	0
1006268	In my conclusion, Korean men should be forced to do military works.	0
1006269	My favorite teacher in high school was my philosophy teacher.	0
1006270	So banning smoking is ideal.	0
1006271	so it is easy to understand the culture of that nation.	0
1006272	Then my teacher punished young children.	0
1006273	If there are no first one, teachers become week and can't lead students.	0
1006274	Students must be punished in moderate way like having a consult or having time for reflecting themselves.	0
1006275	We are not living alone.	0
1006276	If situation goes this way, people would mind to get a surgery.	0
1006277	In that movie 'Sanuki';the famous town because of their delicious Udon, are depicted so static and peaceful.	0
1006278	So, the idea that freedom in the Internet can be conducted is wrong.	0
1006279	Moreover, women in North korea also complete military service.	0
1006280	I like his attitude and want to be a nice person like him.	0
1006281	Very good example of hands-free tools in these days are smart phones such as galaxy and iPhone.	0
1006282	If smokers want to smoke, they just get out of building and freely smoke!	0
1006283	M.	0
1006284	There are a lot of safety items for drivers such as helping them not to hold phones directly.	0
1006285	This shows that children can easily learn violence from physical punishment.	0
1006286	I mostly spend Saturday with my family.	0
1006287	I do not read books in home.	0
1006288	I'm suggesting a way-out for smokers' sake.	0
1006289	He has so wide mind.	0
1006290	The first reason I agree about using animals in medical experiment is that though we lose a few lives of the poor animals, instead if we suceed in making some medical improvements we can save thousands of lives with the sacrifice of the animals.	0
1006291	I can't forget him.	0
1006292	Especially, I composed very beautiful song for heroine and trained her very hard.	0
1006293	We should't disregard teacher's right to keep student's right.	0
1006294	When they get the physical punishment in school, they must think that they need to change mind and go right route.	0
1006295	They just ignore their teacher and only concentrate on what they learn at other private academies.	0
1006296	I got up at 6:30, got a subway.	0
1006297	If he don't want to go to army, then why he should go?	0
1006298	In my third-grade, I had many troubles because I wanted to go university that I really want to go.	0
1006299	So this travel will give me profound experience which will support my dream.	0
1006300	At first when I read that question and I think that using animals in medical experiments is not good way.	0
1006301	In this vacation.	0
1006302	it can be good to both Humans and animals	0
1006303	therefore, I think that the opinion that has a neutral way is wise opinion.	0
1006304	The reason why I like math is that first, I like to study a subject reasoning many facts, and a tool for reasoning was using math.	0
1006305	What I mean is that lots of accidents result in lots of social costs.	0
1006306	And now I think he will be my life-long friend.	0
1006307	People knows using cellular phone is dangerous, and they can be hurt by accident.	0
1006308	Lastly, children who experience the physical punishment in school a lot, eventually get familiar with the violence.	0
1006309	Jeong-Su Oh".	0
1006310	So it's too early to change system that depend on aplicants.	0
1006311	Although there are many reasons about this statistics.	0
1006312	But now we can't find anythings replaced with.	0
1006313	But the most important thing is people's life and health.	0
1006314	I'm proud her.	0
1006315	First, I think that because Korea is cutted country all Korean men must be forced to complete military service.	0
1006316	So I must do the best because my parents are happy when I success something perfectly.	0
1006317	Recently, 'well-being' is our motto in the world.	0
1006318	So in a necessarily, they have to a little physical punishment for controll in their schools.	0
1006319	Tough our tax is spended a lot for volunteers' wealth, that sacrifice is must done for Korean' safety.	0
1006320	If they experience the physical punishment, they will remember and do same thing when they grow up.	0
1006321	It may not be true, but they also chose to be in USA like me, so I want to meet them in America and be their friend.	0
1006322	Saturday is one day I truly enjoy.	0
1006323	And then, they will adjust their acting from then.	0
1006324	Well-organized law system will help that, too.	0
1006325	Students can use this situation badly just like teasing teachers using that situation(not allowing the physical punishment) as arms.	0
1006326	I also feel proud when my friends look at it.	0
1006327	I think animals should be not used in medical experiments.	0
1006328	There is no probability that this accident can not happen in other places like buildings and cars.	0
1006329	In a short i disagree smoking in all public bulidings so smoking should be banned in all public buildings.	0
1006330	It contains lots of letter that i have got.	0
1006331	But If they don't stop at all after that, then they ought to be punished physically.	0
1006332	Yes. I think drivers of automobiles should not use their cell phones.	0
1006333	Actually it is so cruel to animal and we have to know how selfish we are.	0
1006334	The punishment could be either the physical one or vocal one.	0
1006335	because I'm an adult!	0
1006336	Also it helped me to be able to enter Yonsei University.	0
1006337	So I think women also have responsibility for keeping our country.	0
1006338	Humans overlook the truth that not only humans but also animals, bugs and other many creatures are the Earth's member and they have the same rights with humans.	0
1006339	The latter say a lot of thing about military.	0
1006340	And sending text message is the worse thing that distracts the drivers' attention.	0
1006341	he become good mentor and train heavily my mathmetic skill.	0
1006342	Second, physical punishment make children passive and introvert.	0
1006343	I think people should use their real name on the Internet.	0
1006344	For exmaple, while driving, business men take a some critical task and have to call to some other offical man.	0
1006345	If physical punishment not be allowed, there are no ways to these students listen their teacher.	0
1006346	People speak out freely especially when they don't have to show their ID.	0
1006347	solutions with physical punishment are effective.	0
1006348	In conclusion, smokers should not smoke in public buildings.	0
1006349	Drivers should notice about these things, and be careful not to do other things when they driving.	0
1006350	If I give an example, after the law forbidding physical punishment some students ignored their teachers.	0
1006351	That is why we should ban smoking in all public buildings.	0
1006352	It harms smokers themselves and many other people.	0
1006353	First, If Internet users use their real name, they can feel their responsibility to write clean comments or replies.	0
1006354	For instance rats used in experiment usually die many for us but they can be born many by us.	0
1006355	Of course, Smoking itself is entirly personal matter.	0
1006356	First, Using cellphone while driving can disturb the drivers to find sudden obstacles.	0
1006357	On top of that, using celluar phone when they drive is not manner or ethiket for the people who is calling.	0
1006358	My favorite subject was math.	0
1006359	but in some places that people talk about funny and stupid things, we should make people do not have to use their real name in those place so they can talk each other more freely and funny.	0
1006360	And the man or woman who is suffering with the disease which can't be cured can be anyone.	0
1006361	Then when we want to save some dieing people, we have to make many technology and some animals will be victims.	0
1006362	Third, driving with using cell phone may lead to serious problems.	0
1006363	Why think so , no smoker is very hateing smoking smell.	0
1006364	Also, I attend a bookclub meeting once a month.	0
1006365	I'm interested in architecture so Spain is the perfect place to study about architecture.	0
1006366	First, she makes students very comfortable in class.	0
1006367	and i want to learn other science also.	0
1006368	TV showed me about angcor wat.	0
1006369	Second, having trouble with teacher will be more frequent.	0
1006370	I think in my country, Korea, physical punishment is allowed in all schools.	0
1006371	my answer is doing that kinds of responsbility.	0
1006372	I agree that people must ues their real name on the internet.	0
1006373	When they go to a real society no one punish like that, no one think them like that in big world.	0
1006374	So smoking in all public buildings should be banned.	0
1006375	It is less restricted, safer, and has almost zero damage to today's social Internet site.	0
1006376	When car accidents happen, it's not the problem of only the driver.	0
1006377	I love Korean History because the teacher who teached me was very kind and skillful.	0
1006378	But all of above is assuming that using cellular phones means to talk on cellular phones.	0
1006379	it has many information and opinion.	0
1006380	Fortunately, our familly save life.	0
1006381	So the govenment always pursue the army is expanded.	0
1006382	And everybody knows there are more non-smokers in the world and people want to be healthy, away from the cigarette.	0
1006383	She was my first home room teacher.	0
1006384	but I must fill the 300 words in this essay.	0
1006385	Recently, almost of adults have driving license and drive a car.	0
1006386	Especially, When that to study something of which the process includes physical or psychological pain.	0
1006387	But if we ban smoking in 'all' public buildings, there will be serious side effects.	0
1006388	It can't!	0
1006389	We charge our energy in the trip.	0
1006390	In these days, people are very close with animals such as dogs and cats that some people even thing animals as their family.	0
1006391	We don't have much time to play.	0
1006392	This right of freedom includes the freedom of body.	0
1006393	It only makes students fear, and at the same time, hate their teacher instead of respecting, which could also lead to a rather dangerous results.	0
1006394	The changing direction should promote the student's potential at most.	0
1006395	and I think that forced military service can't be a help for korea.	0
1006396	In this sense, my math teacher whom I met in high school is my favorite teacher.	0
1006397	If we can not use animals in medical experiments, naturally our developing speed will be slower than if we can use animals.	0
1006398	So some speech and education are needed.	0
1006399	Also, It was not good to educate students to punish physically.	0
1006400	These students know teachers cannot punish them efficiently, so they do terrible resistance against their teachers and class.	0
1006401	A person who have a pet don't agree the experiment.	0
1006402	1 military power.	0
1006403	I was impressed to giving his services free.	0
1006404	However, it is far more dangerous for people to take drugs without any guarantee that they are safe.	0
1006405	Next, we can song our sense, such as pleasant, sadness, angry and so on.	0
1006406	I really like to talk with my friends.	0
1006407	Then my problem has solved.	0
1006408	Some people might say that this could limit their own right to do what they want to.	0
1006409	Humans have more rights because they live for higher causes.	0
1006410	I was very interested in the tradition and the living style of Japan and it was a good chance to learn about a different culture.	0
1006411	For example, a child who is hided by the car can appear, and the traffic lights is always changing.	0
1006412	Second, By the sacrifice of less number of animals, a lot of lives can be saved.	0
1006413	there were no punishment in law and no revenge.	0
1006414	Solving the problem about it is almost depended on one's creativity to imagine the shape that would need to be solved.	0
1006415	So it wil happens all the time.	0
1006416	Secondly schools have some different way which teacher can manage students.	0
1006417	If they are used in medical experiments, it is not sure their efforts can help humans.	0
1006418	On the other hand, when people using their cellular phones can hear urgent calls or shocking calls that make them embarrased.	0
1006419	Although there are some public buildings which prohibit smoking, some people just neglect it in spite of its bad results.	0
1006420	There are many crimes on the Internet in our society.	0
1006421	Also, children don't admire their teacher because they think their teacher don't seem to have a power.	0
1006422	Because if I do that, my identification will be exposed to the Internet, so I have to hear a reluctant anti-sentiment by other people.	0
1006423	But that's not the same with Korea for some reasons.	0
1006424	I think Korean men who are healthy and afford should be forced to complete military service.	0
1006425	So many people say that we should allow physical punishment again in schools.	0
1006426	That's why talking on the phone while driving should not be allowed.	0
1006427	so i want our country to develope.	0
1006428	And now, I think those punishments make me the better person by noticing my own faults.	0
1006429	I want to claim that we should stop to smok in all building.	0
1006430	First, there are many delicious foods I wanna try.	0
1006431	The real name using was the 'hot' issue about several years ago in korea.	0
1006432	There, my mom bought my 'yangyang' for me.	0
1006433	However, i think they don't understand the difference between 'abuse' and 'use' and importance of pre-test.	0
1006434	Cause she is best person in my life, I like to do everything with her.	0
1006435	I spend time on playing with my boyfriend.	0
1006436	But sometimes a little bit tired and boring	0
1006437	Second, we can prevent many problems that can make us die.	0
1006438	It's okay until graduating secondary shool I condiser forming time.	0
1006439	And Italy is urope country.	0
1006440	Yes.	0
1006441	Second, in his or her adolescence, a student can be very rebellious to their teachers and make a serious mistake.	0
1006442	I met the hiphop in high school.	0
1006443	If our technology grows up and up, we can make robots that have alomost the same as animals.	0
1006444	so they must avoid that place.	0
1006445	There are some reasons that all Korean men have to go military to complete military service.	0
1006446	But I don't agree to that statement because of several reasons.	0
1006447	Second, studying environment will be disturbed.	0
1006448	By that program, women can learn for their deep mother's instinctions and children's loves and contributions for kids.	0
1006449	She showed me a new world about books.	0
1006450	When I was admitted Yonsei University, it was she who most congraturated me.	0
1006451	But when we go somewhere with a phonecall, we can only use a hand.	0
1006452	In other words, nickname is great outlet for tired people like us.	0
1006453	but he is not proud of his voice.	0
1006454	but in korea, many people still maintain smoking in public buildings.	0
1006455	Second, medicins aren't always for human.	0
1006456	they will have responsivility and they will be kind to other people.	0
1006457	Of course, I don't have to have sad feeling.	0
1006458	In my opinion Korean men don't have to be forced to complete military service.	0
1006459	I saw an paper advertisement that show the terrible result of car accident caused by driver's phone call.	0
1006460	Thank you	0
1006461	Because it will exactly reduce the percentage of roots for punishment.	0
1006462	So if there is not allowed physical punishment in all schools, disimprove power of teachers.	0
1006463	If the real name is used, privacy can not be preserved.	0
1006464	Nowadays, one cannot describe the modern culture without the Internet, since the Internet has grown rapidly and changed our society considerably in both positive and negative way.	0
1006465	Second, i think killing animals to do medical experiments is not different with killing animals to eat.	0
1006466	But people staing closer the smoker may intake the very somke.	0
1006467	I think this is the most ideal way of treating smokers.	0
1006468	I like animals and know they have lives and emotion.	0
1006469	All students were cheering like laughing at her and the teacher got mad.	0
1006470	And if moral education is done with netizens, the side effects of using nickname on the Internet like bad-replying will disappear.	0
1006471	Therefore, I agree with use animals in medical experiment and I think it's important process.	0
1006472	Because of that system, America have biggest power in the world.	0
1006473	If the system turn on, you just concentrate your thinking on driving.	0
1006474	But now the number of South Korean military force is far less than North Korean's.	0
1006475	since i weak in memorize part, I was attracted in korean class.	0
1006476	Receiving good grade, I felt much more interest about Japanese.	0
1006477	For examples, he is very kind and honest.	0
1006478	First of all, when the drivers using cellular phones while driving, their attention can be distracted.	0
1006479	so, physical punishment must be allowed.	0
1006480	They could absorb the smoke that smokers expel.	0
1006481	Seosan is the city where I lived for 13 years.	0
1006482	Therefore, schools can be much more happier and peaceful than ever.	0
1006483	So the online world can be more clean world.	0
1006484	Therefore the cross is good for me in many times.	0
1006485	That's very happy.	0
1006486	Of course there are some emergencies while driving.	0
1006487	My Korean teacher in my third grade is the most important teacher.	0
1006488	We need to invest the missile because it is most powerful weapon.	0
1006489	Before the alternatives are found, using animals in medical experiments is the best way.	0
1006490	I agree the opinion that animals should be used in medical experiments.	0
1006491	Many people use their cellular phones while they are driving their cars.	0
1006492	I had a good time with my friends so I have much affection to those places: Harajuku, Sinjuku, Shibuya etc.	0
1006493	The second reason that If Some people smoke in public buildings, Public buildings will be a sea made of only Cigar!	0
1006494	In other words, the students might think that whatever they do could be justified by being physically punished.	0
1006495	Because of these situation, we have to do real name policy.	0
1006496	I like his care.	0
1006497	I was very happy and said thank you to my teacher.	0
1006498	Therefore teacher's right should be protected.	0
1006499	When Korea is unified, just self-supplied men are needed	0
1006500	But Can mice understand human's order?	0
1006501	We need to talk and listen to others.	0
1006502	Although other As do nothing, they could be regarded as bad people.	0
1006503	Safety is the most important because if we do not think about safety, it could bring a car accident.	0
1006504	I want to know various god of Japan.	0
1006505	And it make nation's democracy function more effectively.	0
1006506	Public buildins are the place that many people using.	0
1006507	These days, a cellular phone become a smart phone, and you can do everything, for example watching television, internet surfing, taking pictures and so on with the smart phone.	0
1006508	I play the piano or keyboard my father play the giutar my mother sing a song!	0
1006509	In conclusion, drivers should not be allowed to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1006510	this make our relationship strong.	0
1006511	Second, there are already large amount of animals being on our dinner table.	0
1006512	It is very dangerous to use phone calls when people drive because it can provoke serious car accidents and make victims.	0
1006513	So studying mathmatic is very useful.	0
1006514	Thus, there are other ways to let them know their fault.	0
1006515	If I go japan, I will sincansen travel.	0
1006516	These are my opinions about agree with using animals in medical experiments.	0
1006517	But so little they are.	0
1006518	It was supposed to take last year, but I did one more year to study to go university so I took it this year.	0
1006519	The accident have done by he use celluar phone while driving.	0
1006520	And with these counselling, I can learn a lot for that question and I can take my way more correct and have my own sight about my thought more widely.	0
1006521	I think medical experiments that use animals is necessary.	0
1006522	We played zero game, arm whestling, and so on.	0
1006523	First hand smoking is bad, of course, but second hand smoking is even worser.	0
1006524	I think this question is not valid.	0
1006525	I really hope to experience Indian cuture.	0
1006526	I think that all Korean men need not to be forced to complete military service.	0
1006527	The buildings with public purpose have a responsibility to make a close interact with people.	0
1006528	There are some people who still insist that smoking should be respected at least in a limited place.	0
1006529	Through this system, people will be able to do their works for their nation happily.	0
1006530	So we should take physical education class to make our body and thinking clearly.	0
1006531	I wake up at 10 o'clock and I turn on the computer.	0
1006532	so until now I like biolgy.	0
1006533	In high school, I must study all weekdays.	0
1006534	I might really miss her a lot.	0
1006535	I'm going to say something of my best friend, a girl who I have known for 7 years.	0
1006536	And someone must protect this country.	0
1006537	The first day night, we talk ablout ourselves with something to eat.	0
1006538	Thesedays even teaching animals by hitting is not allowed.	0
1006539	Maybe airplane fees would be relatively cheap compared with other ones to European countries.	0
1006540	She was my third-grade homeroom teacher and math teacher.	0
1006541	Likewise, there are many things we don't know.	0
1006542	No.	0
1006543	Because.	0
1006544	Everything has right time and place, remember it.	0
1006545	So buyer lose money.	0
1006546	In a nutshell, I know that there are many problems made by invisibility of the Internet.	0
1006547	my uncle could not keep up with his classes and had a hard time to remember that he had learned things.	0
1006548	My favorite subject in high school was the Korean history.	0
1006549	The problem to this system is not only this one.	0
1006550	therefore i think we make smoking site and all site but smoking site should ban smoking.	0
1006551	In my experience of living in the US for 1.5 years, there are a lot of place to travel.	0
1006552	If some limitation that save one more people or more safe about life of somes, the limitation most costs.	0
1006553	I think this time is very useful for my family.	0
1006554	So people changed the way for hunting animal.	0
1006555	My best friend is my high school friend.	0
1006556	But, that right should be banned.	0
1006557	So we ask SBS to reproduct DVD of "Prosecutor Princess".	0
1006558	Third, There are a lot of people who are JUST not the kind of military person.	0
1006559	And if teachers punish their students, students who punished by teacher have a bad memory with their teacher.	0
1006560	First, it takes a long time to complete military service.	0
1006561	I have been to Busan to meet my cousins, who live in Busan.	0
1006562	Finally, one's own name is also a personal information, being protecting from hacking, using in crime, and the like.	0
1006563	Many people can't do two things perfectly in same time.	0
1006564	Next, we wet to Seomun Market.	0
1006565	The experience of military service is the way of socialization, which teach adaptability, harmony and relationship.	0
1006566	So we should not allow drivers to phone call by transport law.	0
1006567	"Why don't you do your homework?"	0
1006568	I usually spend my Saturdays with my own time.	0
1006569	As the communication technology evolved, cell phone has became part of life for most people.	0
1006570	As teachers are important, so are students.	0
1006571	This is very important problem.	0
1006572	His name is Sang Beom and I know him because he and I were classmate three years in highschool.	0
1006573	some situation physical punishment is not a deserved thing, and sometiomes it is a deserved thing.	0
1006574	To explain, when I was high school student, my homeroom teacher had student who was discontent with dormitory of the school raise hands and say about it freely.	0
1006575	We sometimes argue for some of reasons.	0
1006576	Therefore, my Japanese grade was pretty good.	0
1006577	My favorite teacher in high school is Young Bae Kim.	0
1006578	By these reasons I think using phones while driving should not be allowed.	0
1006579	Information that we can get by name is the information that we can get without name.	0
1006580	He is 21 years old.	0
1006581	And also, according to the Korean National Reserch Center, the survey shows Korean men who complete military service think it is helpful for adjusting social world.	0
1006582	By using animals in medical experiments, they can also make up more powerful medicines than formal ones or the ones which cure fatal symptoms.	0
1006583	but if we ban the use of celluar phones while driving, it can also creates many troubles.	0
1006584	If smoking in public should not be banned, it's ovious that their health rihgt be violated.	0
1006585	From the early days to now on, there often have been the physical punishment of children in education.	0
1006586	At first, It would bring a side effect.	0
1006587	So Drivers should think that he or she could be a wrongdoer of traffic accident due to the use of cellular phones while driving.	0
1006588	As it snowed much this year, we climed up a snowy meadow and rode a sled made of cardboard box.	0
1006589	But I am not saying that we must not use nicknames.	0
1006590	But that things demand astronomously cost.	0
1006591	And then we don't have to worry about it.	0
1006592	Fortunately or unfortunately, many people use the Internet and write their thoughts in the on-line board these day.	0
1006593	In high-way, they run very fast.	0
1006594	I have never forgotten that experience.	0
1006595	They suffered the bad words and mocking words.	0
1006596	He has to drive and talk on the phone at once, and this is dangerous enough.	0
1006597	Campaign is not enough.	0
1006598	It was one of my happy memory.	0
1006599	My best friend is very smart and study very well.	0
1006600	If internet users present ideas that they can certain, I think there are no problems.	0
1006601	Teacher 'youngmi-choi' teach us many things.	0
1006602	Also, there will be lots of reasons expect my three reason.	0
1006603	He worked in Seoul Sience high school before working my school.	0
1006604	first, compelsary military service damage abilities of the nation.	0
1006605	when watcing tv or internet, many people think modern children are ruder than past.	0
1006606	Some of the smokers doing concern other people But most of smokers doing like not concern anybody.	0
1006607	Above question is very sensitive for all Korean men.	0
1006608	So using cellular phones can't be an exception in this driving principle.	0
1006609	Even though the side effect already appeared at many school, I disagree with the physhical punishment in school.	0
1006610	It is absurd to choose the way that has many negative effects rather than much better way.	0
1006611	Like presenting, cheering letters etc.	0
1006612	If smoking in buildings is allowed, it's hard to deal with extraction of the smoke from the buildings.	0
1006613	In the end, that Book chage me live for my Dream.	0
1006614	I was very impressed by his teachings and learned the joy of obtaining knowledge.	0
1006615	We sometimes go to see the movie.	0
1006616	And in present times we have to use animals, but I think we have to develop our biotechnology.	0
1006617	That people's disagree reason is only at simply feeling compassion for animals, they also object of every situation that animals are killed, and used by human.	0
1006618	This is not an easy question.	0
1006619	So I think that Korean men should be forced to complete military service.	0
1006620	My family and many relatives gatherd in grandma's home.	0
1006621	Superficially, It seems comfortable to drive and calling at the same time in terms of multitasking.	0
1006622	Rather, we have to use this experience wisely for prosperity and co-existance of humans and animals.	0
1006623	so I want to see their great nature direct.	0
1006624	she has passion to work hard how the thing makes her tired.	0
1006625	But huge winds took my eye glasses off, and it broke a front door of our ban.	0
1006626	so I love math	0
1006627	However, I think this kind of education system is not needed nowadays.	0
1006628	Though it is very sad, I believe that all Korean men should fullfill their duty.	0
1006629	But when we are injured, we can not guard these things.	0
1006630	So when war is break, we can't fight very well.	0
1006631	So this people don't nessesary go military army to do military service.	0
1006632	So when the animal is not about to extinct it is OK to use them.	0
1006633	In the first, I was not good at beatboxing.	0
1006634	Sometimes it needs to teach students.	0
1006635	But, Forbidding physical punishment is so good action.	0
1006636	Then, when I was in some problem, she helps me break problem.	0
1006637	In the above reason, I don't like physical punishment and disagree with the argue that it is helpful to the education.	0
1006638	most of people hat and think this system is wrong.	0
1006639	In conclusion, there must be physical punishment in education with strict regulations.	0
1006640	For exemple November 2010, North Korea hits territory of South Korea.	0
1006641	My mother is career woman.	0
1006642	Actually many schools when P. E time they did not tougch the P. E. because school's opinion is We need go to a universty not pysical actions but study English, Koreans, Mathmatics and exam.	0
1006643	But students don't change their bad attitude easily when teacher scolls their students by speaking.	0
1006644	That means if student commit bad things and got physical punishment, (s)he feel he did wrong thing, and he try to improve his behave because of physical punishment.	0
1006645	When hearing his opinion via Internet, people have bad opinion at Korea's economy, so it connects to decrease of consume sums.	0
1006646	So if there little physical punishment, students can`t learn about that things.	0
1006647	Because to day south korea mad.	0
1006648	When people smoke in the street, people walking in the street have to inhale the gas.	0
1006649	All people want live healthier and longer.	0
1006650	In modern times, people almost live alone or small family.	0
1006651	One part is that we have enthusiasm, we can't being beaten.	0
1006652	It's like "student's physical punishment".	0
1006653	First of all, allowing smoking in public buildings can be an unfair way to non-smokers.	0
1006654	As a consequence, these cause drivers using cell phone not to be able to notice the dangerous factors on the road which may make serious accidents.	0
1006655	And I have interesting in the subject.	0
1006656	I'll give thanks to him.	0
1006657	They are waiting of developing of new medicine which make them to avoid their pain.	0
1006658	However we, human being, must use the other animals to survive and to be more healthy.	0
1006659	Because Smokers did not no how serious Smoking effects.	0
1006660	and sign is drama that park sin yang is partcepated in.	0
1006661	So it's problem of the teacher's teaching mind, not physical punishment.	0
1006662	Yes, I think drivers of auto mobiles should not be allowed to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1006663	At least women need to work for a society like play with children who have no parents, nurse a old people who have no family to help them.	0
1006664	But when we need to use animals in medical experiment, we do not have to hesitate about using animals for experiments.	0
1006665	Sometimes, they insult opponents even when they win the game, like saying "Can't you play better?	0
1006666	Government overuses power about freedom for using phone.	0
1006667	We must check effect and harmness of medicine.	0
1006668	And my goal is reading those books all.	0
1006669	because I impressed 'Harry potter' and 'Lord of the ring' These book made from English writter, and based on Englishan emotion.	0
1006670	Trip always makes the solution for me.	0
1006671	I also like him.	0
1006672	If teacher's authority of physical punishement had no limit, teacher might give so terrible or big plunsihement to studnets, and it can make them so tired and terrible hurts.	0
1006673	Is that only way to educate students?	0
1006674	In conclusion, I spend my Saturdays in the library and Fitness club.	0
1006675	But later, I could be used to my work.	0
1006676	human beings should stop using other life for our health.	0
1006677	That is love.	0
1006678	Usually, many teacher was good people.	0
1006679	With this case, we can think about usefulness of physical punishment.	0
1006680	Many people think physical punishment shouldn't be allowed in school.	0
1006681	So our scientists have to research making robotes.	0
1006682	The object that has special meaning for my family is a video camera we've owned for about 20 years.	0
1006683	For example, any children who smoke in early age didn't think the end of smoking like many deasease.	0
1006684	we have to effort that clean our place.	0
1006685	Children is young and immature.	0
1006686	Many of the medical experiments which are done recently include using animals, and they are very helpful in medical developments such as treating disease or changing sick organs.	0
1006687	What subject I like best is Physical Education subject.	0
1006688	m.	0
1006689	But to non-smoking person, misunderstanding about the smoking is really irritating.	0
1006690	So the physical punishment is not for children.	0
1006691	When we arrived, we went Han Ra mountain.	0
1006692	For my family, a teddybear has special meaning.	0
1006693	I hope that people keep their manners by themselves so that legal act should not be needed.	0
1006694	In Korea, most of men in military are university students.	0
1006695	So the person can't be an experiment.	0
1006696	So I think I like her very much because we have not only the opposite but also same things.	0
1006697	Some might assist that this smoking ban can be against ones' right to do what they want to do.	0
1006698	And I often visited some museums.	0
1006699	If they want to use cellular phones, they can stop and use.	0
1006700	I think Most of physical punishment is good for student's studying.	0
1006701	Likethis, she always treat her students in a very kind way when they need some help.	0
1006702	And that's also why I go theater alone.	0
1006703	For these reasons, i think that using the cellular phone while driving should not be permitted.	0
1006704	But Saturday They(plus I) must spend their time with their family.	0
1006705	First, physical punishment is very effective in making students obey in class.	0
1006706	Also, their generation is short.	0
1006707	Second, there are many famous foods like pizza and pasta.	0
1006708	He said that why you have to study.	0
1006709	it is not fair and including main opinion.	0
1006710	We do not want to show our information on the Internet.	0
1006711	Firstly, physical punishment is education for knowing.	0
1006712	. this topic is very sensible.	0
1006713	For example, the Places she visited such as Disneyland, Tokyo Tower, and downtown were all neat and well organized.	0
1006714	So South Korean men and women do their duty which is adequate for them.	0
1006715	I lost my favorite hobby.......	0
1006716	my family don't go to restaurant nearly.	0
1006717	Even when I tried to give up studying, he encouraged me properly, sometimes punishing me.	0
1006718	My favorite subject in high school is Biology.	0
1006719	We have to aknowledge these events sereously.	0
1006720	public building is used by many people(smoking people and not smoking people).	0
1006721	All men should be prepared at military for people's safety and in case of others' attack.	0
1006722	I don't agree with the mandatory military service for some reasons, either.	0
1006723	we also can look back our lives.	0
1006724	Second, math makes me thinker.	0
1006725	If physical punishment should not be allowed in all schools, many students and schools will become messy.	0
1006726	Most of all, I like his positive mind.	0
1006727	It is the main reason of lung cancer, and threat health of people.	0
1006728	In universtiy, i want good teacher who is my life changer.	0
1006729	Another solution is that any company hire smoking people.	0
1006730	We use animals because of human's medical problem.	0
1006731	Most of them have part-time jobs on weekdays, hence Saturday is the most available time for me and my friends.	0
1006732	But, usally I am home.	0
1006733	Before I went there, I thought that economic wealth is one of the 'must have' for happiness.	0
1006734	In that case you cannot understand either what the show is about or what you are sudying.	0
1006735	Because, two opinons have advantage and dis advantage.	0
1006736	However, I think the most interesting event still not happen.	0
1006737	My best subject in highschool was Mathmetics.	0
1006738	Ofcorse some handicaps or crriples and cannot work in military.	0
1006739	I went to academy from March to October in last year(2010).	0
1006740	So, other ways should be applied for students rather than physical punishments.	0
1006741	Teachers use many ways to help their students have high level of academic achievment and morality.	0
1006742	Actually that is one of the reasons that i like her.	0
1006743	And that increased ability can increase the Korea's national power.	0
1006744	And other students quit the school sometimes.	0
1006745	Not using their real name, people can freely say, exchange their opinions.	0
1006746	Finally, people will be reluctant to say their real thoughts if they have to use their real name because their identity is exposed to the everyone.	0
1006747	To prevent the Internet crimes and to make clean Internet culture, the government should force people to use real name on the Internet.	0
1006748	Math taught me value of trying.	0
1006749	any animal want to live more.	0
1006750	this current made children arrogant.	0
1006751	That time, I had a girlfriend.	0
1006752	I like studying and thinking about materials, atoms, and chemical reactions.	0
1006753	Also, government can adjust the price of ciga.	0
1006754	So drivers can be concentrated on driving while talking in hands free.	0
1006755	So, if we do not allow to use cellular phones while driving children can think about how dangerous to use cellular phones while driving and when they will be a driver of automobile they care more about danger of using cellular phones while driving.	0
1006756	Second, prohibiting smoker to smoke in public places might motivate that smoker to stop smoking.	0
1006757	Finally it can be a harm to the harmony of society.	0
1006758	While I am in the library, I read a new book and find another book that I want to bollow.	0
1006759	he also take care of my mood.	0
1006760	Throught animal experiment, medical technology can be developed highly.	0
1006761	If smoking people don't off fire smoked ciger and through trash can(In the trash can there are many used paper), it's fire many used paper it can cause very big dissaster if time is night fire more big and big and then whole the building can fire!	0
1006762	Physical punishment is benefical for students in several things.	0
1006763	my 1st grade writing teacher is my favorite teacher.	0
1006764	It is not fair to force them to complete military service.	0
1006765	and physical punishment of children in schools is old thing, which is not good.	0
1006766	They don't have any power to guard themselves.	0
1006767	However, I decided to get better at math, and I did math study a lot in winter vacation.	0
1006768	Also, we saw many news about cruel punishment in some school.	0
1006769	There are two reasons to support my idea.	0
1006770	During that time, i often went to the teacher's room to ask some questions about that sudject.	0
1006771	The more he gets points, the more he gets punishment - but it is not physical punishment.	0
1006772	When Korean men complete military service, Korean women have 2 years of time to develope themselves.	0
1006773	So those 'up to date' devices don`t make any use.	0
1006774	It carrys all diseases entire the body.	0
1006775	so they use little bit more attention to the words they use.	0
1006776	Sometimes I think that she is quite dumb because she helps others when she is also in some difficulties, too.	0
1006777	People must use animals in their dish to ballance their nutrition.	0
1006778	Therefore it causes displeasure to those who visits the place and even the smokers themselves, because unlike smoking in outdoors, they get to breath more sub-smoke which is more harmful then main smoke they suck with filter.	0
1006779	he went a lot of countries.	0
1006780	We just stayed in the pension and made a dish by ourself.	0
1006781	They can be cure by medicine or just take rest, usually.	0
1006782	But,I will be a good friend to her whenever she want.	0
1006783	I think that stoping physical punishment is not good.	0
1006784	easy problems are good to study basic concept of the part, and hard problems are good to test my ability to solve problems by using various solutions, thinking large-area part concepts.	0
1006785	Korea and japan are very near section.	0
1006786	I tried to answer with body language what he asked to me.	0
1006787	Just as It matters to be polite and respectful in social situations, It matters in online space, too.	0
1006788	You should use your one hand while holding on your phone, that it can be hard to curve with one hand.	0
1006789	It needs lots of money.	0
1006790	i usually play the piano, watch the movie and eat dishes with my friend.	0
1006791	Second, students can be polite.	0
1006792	Today is democratic today and atmosphere has changed to be democratic.	0
1006793	Experiments are helpful in human's medicine.	0
1006794	The second reason is that my favorite soccer player, Ronaldo is the player in real madrid which is one of the famous team in Spain.	0
1006795	But I think these people doesn't know the actual environment of classes.	0
1006796	When saturday, We often participate in game contest and sometimes we won the contest!!	0
1006797	Using th real name on the Internet, I think it's danger.	0
1006798	Because most of students are upset their teacher.	0
1006799	Many people think that real good teacher can teach the child with no physical punishmen and no children do not follow the teacher to well treat.	0
1006800	Above all, socially discriminated peosons, like sexual minorities, foriegn workers no longer share their feelings, sympathies.	0
1006801	According to a research, using real name when people apeal their opinions or they do some researchs makes them to have resonabilities about their answers.	0
1006802	However, so many people applauded and required next story.	0
1006803	For these reasons, i think drivers never use cellular phones while driving.	0
1006804	I don't want to feel bad mind anymore.	0
1006805	Third, physical punishment is just tools in teaching.	0
1006806	when i was sixteen, i went to taiwan.	0
1006807	Other peoles says physical punishment shouldn't be permitted.	0
1006808	However, as new technologies have been developed, we have new methods to experiment the medicines.	0
1006809	After sooneung, I was depressed.	0
1006810	so i think sharing others pain and sadness is much greater than sharing pleasment.	0
1006811	To sum up, by teaching strictly and using physical punishment,I think that student can learn discipline and self control, and even get a good exam score.	0
1006812	In every bad crisies of human beings, we accomplish the solving ways.	0
1006813	First, I like basketball especially.	0
1006814	We often watch about teachers sued by the parents of students because they punished students physically.	0
1006815	These days, some people say that there is no longer need for government to force Korean men to complete military service.	0
1006816	They think young men should work for the country's industry and we can get arms by the money that the young men got through their work.	0
1006817	Because they know other person's name, they can approach things they want more easily.	0
1006818	This financial gap between Koreas also effect to army power.	0
1006819	Instead of physical punishment, personal meeting with misbehaving children or writing about his or her wrong doing several times would be more effective to growing children.	0
1006820	The researches of universities have found that second-hand smoking is much more harmful for health than direct smoking.	0
1006821	In adolesent time, children used to have a little wrong idea with themselves, other people who are in their sight.	0
1006822	Student who is hit his or her hand remind his or her fault.	0
1006823	So, I think the non-physical punishmnent is a better way to deal with children than the physical punishment.	0
1006824	But when trying to save the rights of smokers in public buildings nonsmoker's right have to be destroyed.	0
1006825	For example, famous singer or actors commited a suicide because of other's bad opinion about them in the Internet.	0
1006826	Consequently, human can use animals in medical experiments.	0
1006827	If I have a chance to travel anywhere in the world, I would choose Germany.	0
1006828	That is our duty.	0
1006829	Whenever I watched an concert video, drum`s bits made me very excitng.	0
1006830	And I think it would be also banned in private buildings.	0
1006831	Also if smoking is allowed in public buildings, many people go to those buildings to smoke.	0
1006832	The only difference between two cases is that one case just hurts your feelings but the other case might hurt you 'physically'.	0
1006833	internet is not real.	0
1006834	Second, there is one example if using phone while driving.	0
1006835	So my desire is all of students know this advantages of physical punishment now.	0
1006836	Also, when the anniversary or someone's birthday comes, she played a beautiful music for our family.	0
1006837	First, knowing about the life of the antecedents is very exciting.	0
1006838	Second, we have a same religion.	0
1006839	If one country wants to enpower its military power, they should develop the weapon, not people.	0
1006840	They claim that animals also have right to be treated like human.	0
1006841	It is that animals should not be overused and abused in medical experience.	0
1006842	My interesting thing is Reading a book 'The chronicle of Narnia' Originally, I don't read a fantasy book, Because I think fantasy is childish.	0
1006843	She has never been late for more than 10 years.	0
1006844	So, I think that present Korean military service system has to change readily.	0
1006845	One day, however, when I went to visit my English academy teacher, one high school boy came to me and asked me to teach math and English him.	0
1006846	Researchers use animals because their organs are very similar to human's.	0
1006847	I was right, but she was not only strict but also thoughful.	0
1006848	If the experiments are done on domestic animals, I will strongly disagree with the experiments.	0
1006849	Smoking in public place is real wrong behaving.	0
1006850	First, smoking is very harmful for smoker.	0
1006851	I know that there are some misbelieves about military service and some people think that military service should be abolished.	0
1006852	If there are no merits of using real name policy, I wonder we should insist this policy more.	0
1006853	While the little girl crossed the road, the truck driver used the cell phone and couldn't see her.	0
1006854	I strongly agree with that drivers of automobiles should not allowed to talk to cell phone while they are drivig.	0
1006855	So.	0
1006856	After I took the university enrollment test, I usually watch television on Saturdays.	0
1006857	She didn't say any 'sorry' word.	0
1006858	Also you know that small possibilities of fire should be warned and buildings have lots of potential.	0
1006859	Many people think that punishment is bad and teacher can teach their students without punishment.	0
1006860	we can't let people who have disease die because of animal's life.	0
1006861	Smoking has many things to do with health.	0
1006862	That's because the place that all friends know well is our school.	0
1006863	I like her sharp mind like this.	0
1006864	So, I disagree with using real name on the Internet.	0
1006865	guys always smoking.	0
1006866	Their first mission is leading their students to right direction.	0
1006867	During the trip, although we sometimes have an argument with each other, we enjoyed just being with each other.	0
1006868	And students are not exception.	0
1006869	Cause man-friends are usually in military service too, and girl-friends have owned their own life in studying or business for 2 years.	0
1006870	Actually, I don't have interesting thing in past vacation.	0
1006871	If teachers give students physical punishment in those ways, students will admit about the punishment, and their life would be better.	0
1006872	Men and women have to compete after men complete their military service.	0
1006873	At night I usually read some books.	0
1006874	If the building the smokers are in is a non-smoking place, the smoker must go outside when they want to smoke.	0
1006875	So we should use our real name on the web.	0
1006876	I like a humorous man.	0
1006877	pursuing joy in the their own place has no problem but doing in public area is not a act of authority but act of irritating.	0
1006878	First, throuth using real name many people can get other persons information.	0
1006879	Likewise, physical punishment can Besides, physical punishment can help teachers who are very kind.	0
1006880	It is a promise and purpose of the school.	0
1006881	when I hear the story, I understand ethics very much.	0
1006882	I think that's what I have to do first.	0
1006883	Students who suffer physical punichment are more feeling the hatered with their teach, not respects.	0
1006884	I have many things that I can't talk to anyone.	0
1006885	His treat was fair, and general to all the students.	0
1006886	One more way is 'point' law.	0
1006887	and when I need the math mentor.	0
1006888	This is largely because it is only way to control students.	0
1006889	But, many people don't want to go military service.	0
1006890	I like whole thing of my best friends.	0
1006891	It is a common case that punishment for education develops to be a punishment for punishment.	0
1006892	And he always think about the subject much more than me.	0
1006893	When they are completing miltary service, they don't use their ability.	0
1006894	Friends of 12 will go with me.	0
1006895	Because he gave me so helpful advice when I had hard time about decide my future plan.	0
1006896	For example, a famous singer U-ni suicidied because of vicious comments on the Internet.	0
1006897	Therefore, the modest physical punishment is not harmful at all.	0
1006898	Moreover, I heard that Korean men become gentle and grown-up after serving military work.	0
1006899	In global times, English is very important.	0
1006900	However, for nation's safety, we need this kind of forcing system.	0
1006901	I think if they are celebrity they must do the nobless oblige.	0
1006902	And in public places, some people must be non-smokers.	0
1006903	I have many friends but have only a few bestfriend.	0
1006904	Foreigners usually have impressions on the country by the public buildings.	0
1006905	I miss her very much.	0
1006906	They should be get out of school.	0
1006907	It could protect many non smokers health.	0
1006908	We are using traning animals for all around nature's peace.	0
1006909	Because of it, I could interact with the subject and think more deeply about Korean.	0
1006910	My father also liked playing the guitar, so I have heard songs by father's.	0
1006911	If some students smoke in toilet and their teacher see them, the teacher can use two punishment which are using the physical punishment and using the school rule.	0
1006912	And animals' body are not exactly the same as ours.	0
1006913	I did not expect it would be interesting.	0
1006914	people should use their real name to present his or her opinion in that site.	0
1006915	There is story.	0
1006916	Finally, There are the only physical punishment time in their life.	0
1006917	First, they have to watch more carefully how teachers use their power to their students.	0
1006918	But I began to love it because it was very rewarding subject.	0
1006919	In addition, English has a powerful merit that other subjects do not have.	0
1006920	If this propose is accepted, drivers of automobiles don't use cellular phones while driving and must do.	0
1006921	If teacher don't have authority and power that can punish students, the situation will be worsen.	0
1006922	The first reason I liked it is for my economics teacher.	0
1006923	My favorite subject in high school was history.	0
1006924	Second, it is no use of having so many soldiers in modern war.	0
1006925	But, when I became 19, classes was mixed, and half of my classmates went to other class.	0
1006926	i don't absolutely agree in that country's regulation, but i think that example have to be base when we make public regulation.	0
1006927	Animals eat each other to live.	0
1006928	For these reason, I hope to visit Paris.	0
1006929	Once playing sports each other we were the best friend.	0
1006930	Other drivers say that although they are not good at driving, they use hands-free device that using cellular phones while driving more easier so they doesn't take traffic accidents too.	0
1006931	But in a recent years, war is changing from by men to by button like Iraq war.	0
1006932	Despite of knonwing that smoking is harmful, there are many smokers on Korean society.	0
1006933	My father usually recive the phone while dirive, but this situation somtimes can make the person who calling upset or emberassed.	0
1006934	I uesd it to watch TV, play the game, listen the music, read a book, talk to my friends.	0
1006935	They are company on same planet.	0
1006936	I read some book that the book says an experience.	0
1006937	First, Social must to prevent non-smoker's right.	0
1006938	There is a someone whom I got to know when I was in America.	0
1006939	They are mostly interested in the upper status of military and weapons.	0
1006940	However, still the basic of war is soldiers which is very crucial.	0
1006941	Recently, about ten percent of all pigs in Korea was dead and killed by owners because of virus that makes pig strange.	0
1006942	I have two reasons of my opinion.	0
1006943	His advices are usually good and help me.	0
1006944	So It isn't equal to abolish military service.	0
1006945	car is not your sofa, but a crazy horse which you should take much care of it	0
1006946	So it was really impressive thing to me.	0
1006947	First of all, as you all know, accidents made other drivers or pedestrians hurt or die.	0
1006948	Also i wasn't good student in school but she always call me 'son'.	0
1006949	It is very important about in developing our culture	0
1006950	It's our life or the animals.	0
1006951	And if users not ethical, they might use the real name rule to an bad way.	0
1006952	However, Suddenly, at opposite road, another car was driven with no break, I was looking that car running into our car.	0
1006953	Teachers do not just hit those students without any reasons.	0
1006954	Because she always explained the rules and we agreed that rules.	0
1006955	Non- smokers feel smoking smell very unpleasant.	0
1006956	I have been to USA this vacation.	0
1006957	When I visit the student's house first and talk with his mother, I got so nervous and also worried about student's achievment after my teaching ends.	0
1006958	but often we don't think about that.	0
1006959	in the world almost of the country's government do not force for men to complete the military service.	0
1006960	The animal used for medical purpose is not natural animal.	0
1006961	I bet that we have simmilar experience.	0
1006962	because it is very very fun.	0
1006963	And accidents occur more and more, and person's persistence is shorter and shorter.	0
1006964	I'm actually close to the "7-year" one because it's got so much energy and loves playing with balls for dogs.	0
1006965	When I was in high school, I always had difficulty in studying Korean language subject, but after I met with my teacher, I realize how to approach with the Korean language subject.	0
1006966	About 4:00 pm, I go outside beacuse my friends called me.	0
1006967	Therefore, Physical Education class was my favorite subject in high school.	0
1006968	They not always listen what teachers say.	0
1006969	What I want to say is that all creatures are valuable.	0
1006970	Additionally Math subject has something that other subjects don't have.	0
1006971	Because it has any profits for me, friends, future my wife, and the earth.	0
1006972	When I was middle school student, I was usually punished my teacher because of my mistakes.	0
1006973	somebody think it can be very harmful for growing children.	0
1006974	Because schools must grow students into social people, not only teach them mathmetics or languages, physical punishment is needed.	0
1006975	But these few points are my personal opinion and to obtain the freedom of online I'm pretty sure that we must use real name on the Internet.	0
1006976	If someone has that selfish thought, that have to be banned.	0
1006977	but i don`t like drama of sinderella.	0
1006978	This bond of trust ables friends to share the most frank ideas between each other, which makes 'best friend' the most valuable ones.	0
1006979	Whether she is busy or not, she manages to make room for me when I need her.	0
1006980	Forexample, When Pedesterian walks in diving sign, the car hits pedesterian.	0
1006981	Experiment to human is dangerous.	0
1006982	When I had no idea how to solve a problem, I went to the teacher, asking the solution.	0
1006983	He is my good advisor and best teacher.	0
1006984	Like that I try to reach my goal through obstacles with passion.	0
1006985	But after the clerk disappeared, he started to smoke again.	0
1006986	Therefore, both teachers and students should try hard to solve problems not with physical ways, but with mental ways.	0
1006987	I think it is a very rude to teacher.	0
1006988	Most of people wouldn't say bad words freely if using real name is nessesary They must know that Internet is a kind of public place.	0
1006989	They made some rumor of him and hurt his name, his mind, his fame.	0
1006990	Nowadays, I listened some accidnets because of using cellular phones while driving, and I saw a automobile accidnet about 10 years ago.	0
1006991	If we use animals in medical experiments, lots of animals would die.	0
1006992	In the society there is apparently the relation of the order of powers.	0
1006993	The third reason of my opinion is that it can divide the burden of completing military service for 2 years.	0
1006994	Children have to learn how to avoid same mistakes they did and take appropriet action in the situation they've never been in.	0
1006995	Because of just being with smoker, non-smoker can suffer from lung cancer or other serious diseases later.	0
1006996	To protect non-smokers right, to protect our students, to protect healthy life, smoking should be banned in public buildings.	0
1006997	Then we go to pc room to play computer games.	0
1006998	He did not put pressure on music scores so anyone who shows interest in music class, he gave good points.	0
1006999	Also there is one thing that everyone will think most now.	0
1007000	But If North and South korea is unified, I don't think all korean men should be forced to complete military service.	0
1007001	Of course, this can not replace animals in all kinds of tests.	0
1007002	People are going to be healthy and the ban reduces everybody's costs that were spended for health	0
1007003	It may give me a help and luck.	0
1007004	I went to the Ice Valley in summer vacation with my friends.	0
1007005	The first advantage is the effeciency in education.	0
1007006	And he was very kind to me.	0
1007007	Nowadays, there are many actions for non-smokers.	0
1007008	However, The physical punishment of children in schools has more advantages than disadvantages.	0
1007009	Students who sufferd from physical punishment will become violent and passive citizen.	0
1007010	Especially, in public areas such as museum, theater, hospital and other kinds of buildings, we should know and consider the facts that there are many other people with us and we should fairly share this place together.	0
1007011	I saw the news that student accused his teacher because of his teacher's physical punishment.	0
1007012	Having chance, I want to go Japan.	0
1007013	What do I like about my best friend is her personality; kindness.	0
1007014	Animals think, say and move like human.	0
1007015	So for our society and media's effect, my opinion is that I disagree people must use their real name on the Internet.	0
1007016	My favorite subject in my high school days was math, first of all, because I was so bad in math and I anyway was going to have to take math exam in academic ability test for university, so I determined to like math and at last I indeed liked the subject itself.	0
1007017	Therefore, I usually take rest in my saturdays.	0
1007018	So, What is the best way to punish children?	0
1007019	If i have a chance to travel, i want to visit Italy.	0
1007020	We rode a lot of things like roller coaster, biking.	0
1007021	Yes, I agree to above idea.	0
1007022	That school is middle school.	0
1007023	For example, it can explain how the earth can rotate the sun.	0
1007024	we should admit that teachers are just ordinary people that have emotions like anger.	0
1007025	Some people would say that why only men have to be forced to military and it is not reasonable.	0
1007026	Some saturday I meet my friends.	0
1007027	About 30 years later, the teacher who violently punished him was murdered by his used-to-be student.	0
1007028	Therefor they use animals.	0
1007029	However, that stereotype is an error, in turn, physical punishment in schools is an unjust way for many reasons.	0
1007030	But most important part of geology is very useful in real life.	0
1007031	First, It can teach them what the good thing is and also lead them to the right way.	0
1007032	Therefore, when the Saturdays start, I often order the tickets for the movie with my friends, or sometimes go to friends' houses to have fun.	0
1007033	And we were very interesting for meeting because it was reunion for our.	0
1007034	If someone smoke indoors, those who are in the same place with him would be bothered at least unconsciously even if the smoker don't want to make them upset.	0
1007035	Some people think that making all buildings non-smoking places are too severe policy for smokers.	0
1007036	Finally, he is very funny, He makes joke very well, and they are very interesting.	0
1007037	Any human don't want to die.	0
1007038	The experiments have been saved a myriad of person's lives.	0
1007039	And If they learn exactly what is right thing and what is not right thing, they can do right thing.	0
1007040	So somtimes I helped my parents, brother, friends to fix the computer.	0
1007041	In Korea, military service is.	0
1007042	Secondlly, large number of students per teacher is one of the cause for physical punishment.	0
1007043	Try to stop the car if you need a call.	0
1007044	and with them, program that counts the number of using cell phones while driving must be invented.	0
1007045	The ice and snow were smearing to all of our parts of bodies.	0
1007046	Like this, there are some time people have to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1007047	because of his favor, I can study literature happy, and I can got high score.	0
1007048	Also nowadays many people are using internet and they meet people on the internet by logging in chatting programs or internet cafe.	0
1007049	Then, their wifr, son or many people being kicked or hitted will hurt other people.	0
1007050	Some people who support physical punishment say teachers need means that can take care of children.	0
1007051	Second, He and i met in middle school at first.	0
1007052	That is, All people have the right to choose their behavior.	0
1007053	There are some people just hate the smell of burning cigaret.	0
1007054	However, what about the nonsmokers who stay around smokers?	0
1007055	We have to move to Bundang.	0
1007056	, the number of soldiers doesn't gurantee any victory on the war.	0
1007057	Another thing I like about her is that she teach me my disadvantages.	0
1007058	I do not agree the physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1007059	In other words, I am in favor of the idea that animals should be used in medical experiments.	0
1007060	Physical punishement should be allowed in every school.	0
1007061	However, If public buildings don't allow to smoke, other buildings will follow their rule.	0
1007062	I think that not compelled military service, military service for jobs may be the answer of the matter.	0
1007063	for all people's health, smoking be banned in all public buildings.	0
1007064	His class was not boring and there was nobody who slept in his class.	0
1007065	There are so many negative factors in smoking in public buildings.	0
1007066	We grows them up to eat, and grows them up for our future.	0
1007067	While phoning in rear of stirring wheel, drivers can not contribute all own's attention to driving.	0
1007068	I think that eating susi in JAPAN is different in KOREA.	0
1007069	I believe that physical punishment should be banned for the following reasons.	0
1007070	but i think that these three factors are most important factor.	0
1007071	Students are going to hate teachers who punished them physically.	0
1007072	Drivers of automobiles should not be allowed to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1007073	I have a memory enjoying there, listening to Opera and seeing the animals.	0
1007074	Because the plus effet on physical punishment is more bigger than the side effect on physical punishment.	0
1007075	Many guys hate military service beacuse they think military service get the time like gold.	0
1007076	Teachers are human too.	0
1007077	I think it can be admitted to use animals in medical experiments.	0
1007078	Especially, children and the old can be harmed seriously by smoking.	0
1007079	So I think Korean men should be forced to complete military service.	0
1007080	Oh!	0
1007081	In order to be a fund manager, I must study economics very hard.	0
1007082	Also, the people can not live commonly because e\so many people know them.	0
1007083	she was vary kindfull and always smiled when I go to her.	0
1007084	It is true that it can be called from very import person or company.	0
1007085	First, when he adopted to our home, we were very happy to have another family member.	0
1007086	Second, He has great personality that student irritated by exam to feel comfortable in life of school.	0
1007087	I agree with the statement that people have to use their real name on the Internet.	0
1007088	The center of education is not by cooking children to do right things, but by assisting children to do right things sincerly.	0
1007089	One animal used in medical experiment can save all human!	0
1007090	Most of all, it is important that all people have fine thought so leave only correct and good opinion.	0
1007091	Smokers should smoke in which no one is in except the smokers by themselves.	0
1007092	But It happens now.	0
1007093	Gamer need fast hand and eye to play starcraft2.	0
1007094	By learning German I can learn German culture that I am really interested in and that's why I like German.	0
1007095	But in nations in the world need military to guard their nation.	0
1007096	This topic don't have thinkers.	0
1007097	For example, he always helped handicapped people in welfare center.	0
1007098	they can think over their wrong doing.	0
1007099	If I have a chance to meet the people of Finland, we may share our feelings.	0
1007100	All think health is very important.	0
1007101	It is a great reason, isn't it?	0
1007102	Also, there are problems with religious people who can't hold guns.	0
1007103	It was first time to go to America so I was wholly excited.	0
1007104	A little expensive, but we eat pig.	0
1007105	It gave me a great embarrasment.	0
1007106	If drivers of automobiles use cellular phones while driving, accidents must be bigger.	0
1007107	After a year with him, I was none to second in Math.	0
1007108	I was 3rd grade in the past vacation, so I and my friends were studying in the classroom.	0
1007109	only administor of hompage on the Internet know privacy of people.	0
1007110	Another reason why I suggest physical punishment be abolished is some teachers have done physical punishment with excessive.	0
1007111	frirst, if i am paid by his parents, our relationship will be uncomfortable.	0
1007112	It is also the same in my case.	0
1007113	So I do not agree with the physical punishment of children in shcools.	0
1007114	My mother is a teacher, so I heard many examples of this.	0
1007115	I think the issues should be known by all even if those has bad effects.	0
1007116	They insist that military have to change to choicing.	0
1007117	so, i and my friends had dicided to congraturate my approval.	0
1007118	Second reason is that men who are forced to complete military service are in his most creative life time in college.	0
1007119	He make me feel good about chemistry.	0
1007120	If we were to let drugs hit the market without being thoroughly tested, we would face dreadful consequences: child deformation, spread of infectious diseases, and even extinction of species.	0
1007121	A little concerning, thier can be peace and good relation of smokers and non-smokers.	0
1007122	This case is not just a case but the start of the war.	0
1007123	Lastly, we can see usually deceit about internet.	0
1007124	So for the safe of the driver, using cellular phone while driving should not be allowed.	0
1007125	so many children are exposed to the adult things.	0
1007126	It was pretty big event for me to go abroad at that age so I remember more clearly than any other contries I have visited.	0
1007127	Also, strange odor cigarettes emit makes most people annoyed, some dizzy.	0
1007128	I would like to recommend hands free.	0
1007129	How I don't like ethic?	0
1007130	Entertaining is second thing.	0
1007131	I hope to the trip in the world and I learn history, cultures, everything.	0
1007132	Most importantly even how much effort the government will put preventing drivers from useing phone can be accomplished.	0
1007133	As far as physically and mentally injured children from punishments in schools are still increasing every year, I disagree with the physical punishment of children in schools.	0
1007134	smoking places should be set in the area where childrens or non smoker are not hang around.	0
1007135	For example, I like to watch hollywood movies and hear the pop songs.	0
1007136	The first thing that we have to ban smoking in public places is for non smokers.	0
1007137	In this situation, the possibility of internet crime is very high.	0
1007138	I don't like spend a time meanless therefore I usually find new things that I have not been for.	0
1007139	When people pay attention other things even if it is close to one people can not see that one.	0
1007140	She said she really wanted to give up making her students listen to her, and ignore them.	0
1007141	Once a day, you suddenly want to smoke while you are in pubilc building.	0
1007142	Moreover, on the Internet, people swear and intentionally spread rumors that is not true.	0
1007143	when some students commit wrong work, what if we don't have any phisical punishment?	0
1007144	So They should not use cellular phones while driving.	0
1007145	And I want a go to the conservetory.	0
1007146	I'm very happy that i can study more about physics.	0
1007147	Internet is become to defensive world.	0
1007148	Some smokers say smoking would release their tension and stress.	0
1007149	Secondly, To complete military service is that a korean men's duty.	0
1007150	I think this result is caused by uncarefulness of Korean drivers and the panalty that is not hard.	0
1007151	I think there can be advantages if a man is forced to complete military service.	0
1007152	Showing one's real name on the internet infers to the higher possibility of threatened privacy.	0
1007153	We have a meal together and go on a picnic.	0
1007154	So I like math	0
1007155	But these are not good things, these should be educated.	0
1007156	My mother is non-smoker.	0
1007157	But using animal for our own benefit not to survive is not right thing.	0
1007158	I think that my family's car has special meaning for me and my family.	0
1007159	These days, some teachers don't have love of their students and do a lot of physical punishment.	0
1007160	They last long, so long that even after the smoker him/herself leaves the place.	0
1007161	But in our society, we select democracy and prohibit the level in society.	0
1007162	The most interesting thing that happened to me this past vacation was a trip to Mt.	0
1007163	most students want to be educated.	0
1007164	If physical punishiment is not allowed in all schools, most teachers can't do anything because of their social wickness.	0
1007165	They must know that they can deprive not only their life, also other innocent people's life.	0
1007166	It was so impressive that I cannot forget and miss that experience in these days.	0
1007167	It was very good experience.	0
1007168	That time I think so good teacher, however nowdays I think that make my class so lauder.	0
1007169	My favorite teacher in high school is my third classroom teacher.	0
1007170	There are two reasons of this.	0
1007171	It teached me how hard to earn money and I realized the value of money.	0
1007172	Whenever we fought, it made us stay in a same place.	0
1007173	Like this, the smoking has any profit at all.	0
1007174	I have learned playing piano since I was 5 so I was very good at piano in high school.	0
1007175	Also being banned in all public buildings.	0
1007176	Smoker has a liberty for smoking, and we don't ignore that.	0
1007177	Physical punishment is like this.	0
1007178	And physics is also helpful for my health.	0
1007179	I like all the famous soccer players but all of them I really like Gerrard who is the star player of Liverpool. he is the excellent midfielder.	0
1007180	If this acts happen, user will not be able to write the freely.	0
1007181	Some years ago, cigarettes are viewed just as somthing natural.	0
1007182	At the end, physical punishment will not disappear in the world.	0
1007183	And after passing the bill of stopping the physical punistment in Seoul, behavior of teens are going serious.	0
1007184	Than people can't express their opinion because of them.	0
1007185	Even adults who have received high level of education commit crime and go to jail.	0
1007186	Chang.	0
1007187	For example, 'Inception' is one of the best movies I think.	0
1007188	If students can estimate teacher and teacher have to explain the reason of hitting, teacher can't overuse the power.	0
1007189	Some singers or actors killed themselves because of the Internet.	0
1007190	Driving test has three part and I all passed it.	0
1007191	This men always struggle to win the league.	0
1007192	Humanbeing lives, so animal's medical can be developed.	0
1007193	lf teacher can't punish their students, students think that they have not to follow teacher.	0
1007194	Smoking harm not only smoker but also other people around them.	0
1007195	But people think it is not bad and it is necessary for life.	0
1007196	When students don't listen to the teacher's words, don't pay attention, don't respect the teacher, it is very hard to discipline the students who are doing wrong things by just talking to them.	0
1007197	We need prevention for that case.	0
1007198	So my father said he was heartbroken.	0
1007199	(Keep imagining.	0
1007200	For example, she loves movies and so do I,especially family movies.	0
1007201	And if it is controlled by bad person, then it can be a disaster.	0
1007202	But I'm not saying many middle school teachers always do physical punishment to their students when they have a wrong.	0
1007203	So the other ones should be angry because the one who use his cellular phone might be slow.	0
1007204	I want to ask them this question : Which one do you think is more important, your dog(animals) or your life(human).	0
1007205	I always learn from him.	0
1007206	This happens when drivers concentrate more on driving rather than phone calls.	0
1007207	If I must stay for a long time because I have to deal with something and smokers are everywhere, then next time I might try to avoid going that place again.	0
1007208	When I meet them, I feel enjoyed and I thinke that my weekends are great.	0
1007209	I know there are people who want to be special on the net.	0
1007210	I went U.	0
1007211	I couldn`t remember the last time my family get together to take a trip spent the time skiing all day and night, so we werea little bit tired.	0
1007212	But I think that two opinions are wrong, and animals should not be used in medical experiments.	0
1007213	But it has many users, so we can't ban it for now.	0
1007214	It made me happy.	0
1007215	Second, the punishment gives a lot of time to understand their misbehaviors like a teacher.	0
1007216	After that he overeat on the way.	0
1007217	I spend about 3 hours in this place.	0
1007218	Also I can meet across American and American TV shows on television very easily.	0
1007219	Korea should show strong force to other countries todays.	0
1007220	So if I have a chance, I really want to go to a non-English using country.	0
1007221	If we use animal for experiments, we will save millions of people's life.	0
1007222	So people know that physical punishment is bed because america school don't have it.	0
1007223	Today, scientist's conscience is becoming hot issue.	0
1007224	There is a stastic about the relationship between accident rate and using cell phone, and it shows how cell phone using can be dangerous while you are driving.	0
1007225	So I think for punishment of student who late in school, volunteering or minus of their score instead of physical punishment is good for their future.	0
1007226	The ways of her instructing son (equalls me) let me go the Yonsei University and I really thanks for that.	0
1007227	The important thing is how to use it and what for use it.	0
1007228	In the first place, the smoke and other toxic materials from the cigars pollute the air and walls of the building.	0
1007229	A few months ago, government banned physical punishment in schools but a few weeks ago, government change the rules to allow little punishment.	0
1007230	If we need to test new medicine or medical skill, we do experiment which people take part in.	0
1007231	Studying about fast time is worth thing.	0
1007232	For examples, bad replies and some illegal acts exist.	0
1007233	Even some people can't breathe in place where is filled with fog that comes from smoking.	0
1007234	For example, in morning, I meditated under the blue sky with teachers.	0
1007235	We were studying harder and harder.	0
1007236	The freedom of speech is the crucial factor of the democracy, and the Internet with anonymous made a great development of global communication.	0
1007237	make students to angry is not a right education.	0
1007238	The first reason to ban using phones while driving is that the phone call disturbs drivers' concentration on handling a car.	0
1007239	The another reason is that women can be a important role at a war.	0
1007240	This type of students don't need physical punishment.	0
1007241	Lastly, there are men who have responsibility to take care of their families.	0
1007242	Seorak with my friends.	0
1007243	If someone who think correctly say his or her opinion, It's just another "Food" to them.	0
1007244	Though TOTO is an animal.	0
1007245	They have to pay for it.	0
1007246	Smokers will need higher medical care for their health, but they will still smoke.	0
1007247	So, they should think other person's health.	0
1007248	So I'm going to resist the government.	0
1007249	If we spend more money to military service we should spend less money to other department.	0
1007250	If a person is smoking in buildings without windows or little windows, it makes hundreds of terrible materials in their places for more than three hours.	0
1007251	Second, using cellular phone distracts attention from driving.	0
1007252	I see it from her, and reflect on myself.	0
1007253	Of course, making other people uncomfortable cannot be justified.	0
1007254	first I hate math.	0
1007255	And medical experiments need diverse and living subjects.	0
1007256	Lots of students are well behaved but there are exceptions.	0
1007257	There is a right for each of people not to inhale smokes by smokers.	0
1007258	and taking account of geometrical circumstances and North Korea, Korea need a lot of soidsers.	0
1007259	Secondly, one of the role of the teacher is to be a role model to students.	0
1007260	So physical punishment which can be thought as not respecting students isn't a good way to instruct students anymore.	0
1007261	Second, using animals in medical experiments is not right for itself.	0
1007262	Actually, 2nd or 3rd smoking that is caused by ashes or fog of cigar is worse than 1st smoking.	0
1007263	But recently, I use my time to see movies or read books.	0
1007264	Because smoking is very harm to all people who not only smoker but also the other people.	0
1007265	This kind of thinking break our society especially when the leaders of korea did not completed military service.	0
1007266	Many Korean men dislike to go millitary service.	0
1007267	It is teacher's best tool of limit students.	0
1007268	I agree Using real name can prevent from criminal.	0
1007269	Second, it has no question that second-hand smoking is very harmful to people's health.	0
1007270	Second i`m tagundo 2 dan.	0
1007271	For example, Shumann and Mahler are composers of German.	0
1007272	That's big problem.	0
1007273	Talking with her, teacher can learn what make her student do bad things, understand her student's deed, forgive her, and solve the problem together.	0
1007274	For example uniform, picture of soccer players, and there are real soccer player who I want to watch.	0
1007275	education is korean power.	0
1007276	some people say that other contrys do not the physical punishemt.	0
1007277	Kids just know they can show their thinking on the Internet but they don't know about how others will feel if they say too harsh or too unideal on them.	0
1007278	Emotional embrassment is short, but the lesson lasts long.	0
1007279	The trainer and I even go to swimming for playing.	0
1007280	I think it remain me that studying is good beause I had physicl punishment for not studying.	0
1007281	That must be a terrible disaster to you and to the man.	0
1007282	I don't agree that Animals should be used in medical experiments.	0
1007283	So keeping promise well, thinks about other people, and always smiling is the things that I like from him.	0
1007284	Because they have sentiment, we should make them more happpy.	0
1007285	Since the human history is started, there are many efforts to correct other people's behavior.	0
1007286	but this behavior is saved many way, also people don't use real name in these acting.	0
1007287	at twenties, Men learn and experience many things in the method of seeing the world.	0
1007288	For example, a famous korean celebrity did suicide.	0
1007289	If there are hard punishments, that student never hit or treat teacher.	0
1007290	Why they have to be hurt by other's will?	0
1007291	To prevent war and protect people, military service should be mandatory to Korean men.	0
1007292	People used animals for medical experiments.	0
1007293	In other words, physical punishment cannot make students to be a 'good boy'.	0
1007294	Using the earphones or not, telephoning always distracts the driver.	0
1007295	They need to know the reason.	0
1007296	For example, In Seoul, physical punishment is baned by the top of teaching section, Kwak.	0
1007297	Like there are some problems makers in students, there are too in teachers.	0
1007298	If smoking in puplic place is hard, many smokers should decrease their smoking time.	0
1007299	So i will do these things from now.	0
1007300	As a result only the small amount of professional soldiers are needed.	0
1007301	they have must study very hard but go to the military is complete non everything.	0
1007302	In other words, the writing in the web can very loud and killing voice.	0
1007303	therefore apropriate physical punishment is dispensible in schools to develope social norm that is desperately needed in these day.	0
1007304	Do you think it is right opinion ?	0
1007305	I went through the high school's life.	0
1007306	but if i is non smoking people, ciggrate' smoke is disgusted in non smoking people.	0
1007307	If every drivers didn't watch DMB or using the cellular phones while driving, rate of car accident greatly decresed.	0
1007308	first of all the punishment gives them feel tight.	0
1007309	But teachers punish them physically, they tend to obey and change their behavior.	0
1007310	His privacy doesn't protected.	0
1007311	She lived with us since my father got married.	0
1007312	Whenever he fed his dog, he hit the bell.	0
1007313	By control words that we use, internet will be peaceful space.	0
1007314	When I go to school on Saturdays, I spend my Saturdays at school.	0
1007315	I think only the people who has nothing to do in their 20's or someone who likes and is willing to do military service must do the military service as their job.	0
1007316	History has reality.	0
1007317	Regarding alternatives provided by the government, I have to say that the nation is doing its best to help their men serve the service.	0
1007318	Smoking section cannot completely block the smoke, so that idea is not clearly solve the smoking problem.	0
1007319	One of the other reason is people are already so used to the way they are using the Internet now.	0
1007320	That happend when i was middle school student.	0
1007321	I really felt that there was foreign country.	0
1007322	I remember my favorite teacher in high school was my first-grade teacher.	0
1007323	and also by counseling with children, they can actually solve the problems.	0
1007324	Without his helps, I cannot enter YSB.	0
1007325	It might seriously hurts some other people including yourself.	0
1007326	Those discareful act could develop to the big fire.	0
1007327	Step by step, I should study about what he will study.	0
1007328	I think the truth that It is on the opposite hemisphere means it is very exotic to our view.	0
1007329	So I really appreciate that point.	0
1007330	People have at least a one thing which has special meaning for themselves, and they consider it as valuable although it is very small and normal and it cannot be seen very special by other people.	0
1007331	And when drivers who use cellular phones drive, because using cellular phone can distract cellular phone-using driver's concentration on drive, it can interrupt non-cellular phone using drivers way.	0
1007332	I believe that we have to use animals for our nation and the world though some people's thought are also careful.	0
1007333	Drivers of automobiles should not be allowed to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1007334	I have to undertstad the subject.	0
1007335	So there have been many disputes about using animals in medical experiments.	0
1007336	I always think parent is now more considerate than student.	0
1007337	And if the problem is not solved, the school board punish the student.	0
1007338	Most of the people want to live longer than now.	0
1007339	We just read about the news and enjoy talking aoubt our own opinions.	0
1007340	For instance, in USA men are not forced to go to military.	0
1007341	when my family get home at night, he always follow us and shake his tail.	0
1007342	Why human being can kill animals or plants, but can't kill other human?	0
1007343	But if we use our real name on the Internet, We can't talk about our problem or privacy on the Internet because we will feel everyone know who write a problem or privacy.	0
1007344	Because I know that the system to make the children to conform to teachers is also important.	0
1007345	it is basic human rights with no exceptions.	0
1007346	Physical punishment can give us strong image.	0
1007347	I have a best friend and we have known each other for over 10 years.	0
1007348	Goverment said that this year the navy applyer was increasing now.	0
1007349	Men need to obey to other men who have higher position than himself.	0
1007350	that is why people say the internet has a lot of dirty websites and not esay to believe.	0
1007351	I favorite my high school teacher in 1, 2 grade.	0
1007352	That activities are funny and rewarding.	0
1007353	A nickname can't replace real name's power to a human's image.	0
1007354	This topic is important as other medical problem.	0
1007355	So we should select men who is proper for millitary service.	0
1007356	this mean automobile accidents are so serious and often.	0
1007357	People don't think about other's right to be respected.	0
1007358	That is, the medicines invented by this experiments shouldn't be used for a person's joy.	0
1007359	Any people can do that.	0
1007360	like Nobel Peace Prize award, expressions about 류사오보 are restricted by china government.	0
1007361	But someone should to be sacrificed to block other's damage due not to having medical experiments.	0
1007362	Math is the most interest subject in my high school time.	0
1007363	Because someone can go wrong when they use drugs that are very successful in medical experiments using animals.	0
1007364	I didn't walk myself because I was so hurt.	0
1007365	The reason we had a trip there is we are very active boys and love the nature and ocean.	0
1007366	But banning smoking in all public buildings is the solution for the problem?	0
1007367	when i was in high school, my favorite subject was math.	0
1007368	I heard that during the time serving military service they are told that the decision Korea made is always right and North Korea is our enemy.	0
1007369	After dinner, we went to singing room, the teacher not absenting for his family.	0
1007370	This situation is surely unfair.	0
1007371	oneday I was very angry with my friend because I thought she was bothering my study so I determined to fight with her.	0
1007372	In P. E. class I could play with balls like soccer, soft ball, basketball and run and jump.	0
1007373	And I heard that also there are a lot of art paintings I like.	0
1007374	Ofcourse some medical experiments doesn't has the purpose to save life.	0
1007375	Public buildings are place for many people.	0
1007376	So i tried to give her what i was raised, that makes me here.	0
1007377	i really want this.	0
1007378	Because many adults spend a lot of money buying cigarretts, if we can cut the money buying cigarretts, we can save money to keep household economy.	0
1007379	Of course physical punishment has been traditionally treated like some sort of education.	0
1007380	I traveled England and France on my past vacation.	0
1007381	Of course, In his/her family or friend in the car, and opposite car too.	0
1007382	He knows a lot of interesting jokes or stories.	0
1007383	Second, it is hard to make sincere conversationsins with automobile drivers.	0
1007384	We have too many things to do that we can only do when we are young.	0
1007385	I assume the reason is that people think real name cannot identify many people.	0
1007386	I am proud them because they are pioneer.	0
1007387	Right, I agree.	0
1007388	Car accident is only driver's fault, but hurt not only drver but also other people and driver's family.	0
1007389	Well some of them will trying to quit smoke but the chances are very low, and some of them may find a place that cannot be easily seen in public buildings and they gather and smoke!	0
1007390	Most friends just pass away, but he really worry for me.	0
1007391	But if physical punishment be not allowed in all schools, the childrens don't know their problem.	0
1007392	Some people grow animals to eat, to pet.	0
1007393	We are very close friend.	0
1007394	When the accident happened, another driver was using a cellular phone and he can not listen horn of her father's car.	0
1007395	In this way, both men and women can help each other and make synergy-effect.	0
1007396	I will introduce the story that why she became my favorite.	0
1007397	If drivers use cellular phone while driving, drivers will not be concentrated on driving.	0
1007398	So I decide that everyday i will solve the math problem 20 qustions at my own math note.	0
1007399	And my father know it.	0
1007400	If physical punishment is not allowed, students will not hear whatever teacher says.	0
1007401	In turn, this increases the possibility of some non-smoking people getting fatal diseases such as cancer.	0
1007402	Almost high school teacher`s class was very boring.	0
1007403	Frankly speaking, Korea doesn't have any winner of Novel prize at science.	0
1007404	In the same time, we think go on about other way we remain the line.	0
1007405	I understand them and I don't hate them.	0
1007406	you just think about it "It just familly trevel.	0
1007407	She rarely changes her words what she said.	0
1007408	So I have good impress of physical punishment.	0
1007409	From this point, I strongly agree that smoking in public buildings must be banned, because it can not only give a bad influence to people indirectly, but also there are plenty areas are provided where people can smoke.	0
1007410	There was a study, which compared two group of people.	0
1007411	For these reasons, I think all Korean men completing military service should be mendatory.	0
1007412	If smoking make people sick, people should be treated in hospital.	0
1007413	We had a dangerous war and have several conflicts with North korea.	0
1007414	But I rahter disagree with that statement.	0
1007415	Korea needs to military service for its speciality.	0
1007416	I was very impressed of his works because it is really cool.	0
1007417	In result I had admission in yonsei univ.	0
1007418	but driver who use cellular phones while driving drives with onlyone hand and their reaction is slower than two-hand driver.	0
1007419	Only a few telented drummers made a great success, and the others are having a hard time fight for their life.	0
1007420	If teachers have rights to take physical punishments to them officially, the students can not ignored teachers.	0
1007421	Some people might think that physical punishment should be allowed in all schools.	0
1007422	My parents also take care of Lotty like a family member, and they also think of it as a luck bringer.	0
1007423	It harms us.	0
1007424	My subject isn't about biological, but he had spoken many thing that we can try and we can do.	0
1007425	And the reason that i choose the France to the first place to want to go is that i heard my friend's experiment when she live in france.	0
1007426	If physical punishments are not allowed, many schools are going to get a headache about student violations like smoking, not attending school, breaking the school facilities and so on.	0
1007427	But I disagree to the statement that teachers can give physical pain to students for educational purpose.	0
1007428	I always had hard time with unclearness of the answers.	0
1007429	"	0
1007430	My best friend, Chan Woo, is very warm and soft - somehow like girl.	0
1007431	In Korea, smoking is allowed in the building and most of restuarants.	0
1007432	but, their mind is understandable.	0
1007433	I think all korean should be forced to complete millitary service.	0
1007434	And that made students more violent and stressed.	0
1007435	First, she understands students' ideas or thoughts.	0
1007436	For instance, someone who want to have a real meeting on the Internet uses messenger.	0
1007437	The main reason is that North Korea and South Korea is still in war.	0
1007438	There is a research that second-handed smoking is more critical than direct-smoking.	0
1007439	In these days, this topic is hot issue.	0
1007440	Smokers can't smoke in all public building, so some of them reduce can smoking, and finally some of them can quit smoking.	0
1007441	He decides to act more rude.	0
1007442	The only way to control the student is punishment.	0
1007443	nobody has power to attack other people.	0
1007444	Almost physical punishment at school is plsced in front of classroom.	0
1007445	If this rule is applied, swearing will be less than now.	0
1007446	When using the phone while a person drived in the city, he listened the shocking news just like someone's death.	0
1007447	we must think that they are animals and we are animals too.	0
1007448	That experience will push people's life to success and happy because when people have some trouble, they will think what they have in military service.	0
1007449	I think it is important.	0
1007450	So I think that to save many lives, we should experiment with anmials.	0
1007451	Resultly, I agree using the animals in medical experiments.	0
1007452	That was totally interesting vacation.	0
1007453	Nowadays the it's a big problem that people can do someting on internet with seal their name.	0
1007454	If some problems happen to children and it is something wrong, teachers should not use their violences and should talk and speak to children that this thing was good and that thing was bad.	0
1007455	The car road is very dangerous of that some of people that do not have recognization.	0
1007456	In fact, when our classmates and I were having hard time preparing for university entering exam, she prepared a surprise party for us and it really helped us control the pressure.	0
1007457	They are too young to know why the education is neccesary.	0
1007458	Because of scary feeling of physical punishment, students pretend to obey their teachers.	0
1007459	But today, It is kind of emergency.	0
1007460	Men go to the army and our nation is protected by the army.	0
1007461	For example, chickens are dying because of influenza, and pigs and cows are dying because of desease called kujeyuk in Korea.	0
1007462	If it really happens, what is fault of a person driving or walking?	0
1007463	So I think that mental punishment is a better way to change stundent.	0
1007464	Because of these two aspects, my thought of military service is all men should be forced to complete military service.	0
1007465	And first grade of high school, I went to China.	0
1007466	That's why I love the history the most in subjects.	0
1007467	Turn off the cellular phone while driving and just keep concentrate on where they're going.	0
1007468	Last year in January, the traffic was paralized because too much snow is piled up on the road.	0
1007469	My family is always give me a big courage and love.	0
1007470	But, solutions are vector, function and my idea.	0
1007471	Third, we can be confused online because of the same names.	0
1007472	On the internet, people get brave in the situation that they are not known to other people who they are.	0
1007473	In conclusion recent war want good arms, plane, big ship, not many people.	0
1007474	Already they take lots of our life.	0
1007475	that is my saturdays.	0
1007476	This situation appear of physical punishment will be allowed in schools!!	0
1007477	If I am the man I call 119 (or 911) altough I am driving.	0
1007478	The proper solutions that can alternate physical punishment have not existed until today.	0
1007479	By these ways, students can understand teacher's punishment, and teachers can lead students good way.	0
1007480	Furthermore, by-passers who just walk around also can be included in that accident.	0
1007481	His mind and though are deeper than before he went army.	0
1007482	It can be a burden to express their thinking.	0
1007483	'We all have a right to doing somthing we want to.	0
1007484	In korea, many parents and teachers use physical punishment.	0
1007485	So we afried in to the swimming pull.	0
1007486	We should think about these things before driving.	0
1007487	First, physical punishment is the most effictive way of decipline in our society.	0
1007488	I don't agree with this opinion.	0
1007489	these day, adolcent student are very sharp and stick charicters.	0
1007490	i love cat , dog, dolphin and many animals.	0
1007491	education's aim is not to make children just graduate school without trouble, but think right way, respect their teacher and love their own society.	0
1007492	When I was high school student, I was very tired to study.	0
1007493	My first voluntary activity was visiting the helpless home and clean their rooms.	0
1007494	Also even their circumstance and family members could be damaged.	0
1007495	Finally, when using real name, same as Paragraph2, people become responsible about their opinions on the internet, and also become respectful to other's opinions.	0
1007496	In this today, Smoking is very risky for people.	0
1007497	I have a best friend who I love almost more than my family.	0
1007498	Because I took a test to go to pharmacy school.	0
1007499	I like him because we've been friends for a long time, about 7 years.	0
1007500	Because earth science have astronmy.	0
1007501	Second it makes children's interesting in their academic subject or their school life disappear.	0
1007502	Furthermore, a few science shows on the TV (i.	0
1007503	politics or judge some person is not a thing we can talk for fun.	0
1007504	I think the physical punishment is in society to go the prison.	0
1007505	Students and parents were appreciated that their or their sons' or daughters' right as a person finally are accepted.	0
1007506	I usually spend my Saturdays by enjoying my time.	0
1007507	So, to solve this problem, we need to look into military system of our neighorhood country, U.	0
1007508	In addition, accidents can make traffic jam.	0
1007509	Second, my friends visited Japan before.	0
1007510	First perform was classic.	0
1007511	is hated by many people.	0
1007512	Of course the girl's act was not student's.	0
1007513	And she is always near me when I feel lonely, happy and sad.	0
1007514	For example Ramyeon, woodong and so on.	0
1007515	Especially in Korea, the think that all the men should complete military service has been a usual thing, so the role of it can be very important in the korean community.	0
1007516	And smoking area should be small because more smoking, more dangerous.	0
1007517	And I also think they can.	0
1007518	I prepare journey to visit all of my country, so I work hard to earn some money.	0
1007519	But I think we need to accept an exception.	0
1007520	that escaping story is the end.	0
1007521	most smoker was not think about the other people so teach them about the situation.	0
1007522	Consquently, what I want to tell them is that when people die we cannot return it.	0
1007523	Then I watch news during dinner and talk about today's social issue with my family.	0
1007524	physical punishment is easy and effective way to treat bad students.	0
1007525	Secondly, smoking can make fire disaster.	0
1007526	Second, compelling people to use real name on the Internet will limit the freedom of speech.	0
1007527	She hurt my hands and ordered me to put my hands up.	0
1007528	My best friend is my roomate in dormitory for 3 years.	0
1007529	Firstly, physical punishment has no effect in correcting children's wrong doing.	0
1007530	So, to prospect human civilization, we can use animal in the ewperiment.	0
1007531	Physical punishment should be banned in schools now and everywhere, especially in elementary schools.	0
1007532	In my country, their even some entertainer kill themselves because of the bad ripples on the internet.	0
1007533	I have heard preparing law about banning the smoking in all public buildings.	0
1007534	For ages physical punishment by teachers has been considered as a method of teaching in schools.	0
1007535	I have believed that my mother's stick for punishment made me realize many things.	0
1007536	The subject I liked most in high school was science, especially biology.	0
1007537	Some media talk about crime's rights, even people who must not be called human.	0
1007538	I was really impressed, because I had heard that some foreigners ignore Korean.	0
1007539	And it can teach them that bad awards are following bad behaviors.	0
1007540	First, even if you need a realname to sign up some webpage or write a comment or opinion, it is easy to use other name like their parent or their friends.	0
1007541	I searched about atom after school time through books and internet.	0
1007542	When I got a bad reply, or the reply that I don't like, I just igrore it.	0
1007543	I said maybe.	0
1007544	First, not only talking on the phone but also by earphone and headsets can drop a degree of concentration.	0
1007545	Drivers must considerate other drivers.	0
1007546	But our country's population is less than 50 milions.	0
1007547	This law was made recently.	0
1007548	Anyway, it was very impressive thing that happened to me this past vacation.	0
1007549	So when he got a baby, I give some baby clothes to my teacher.	0
1007550	If these things are properly acting our school would change to a better place for stundent and teachers.	0
1007551	And at night, there was a fountain show starring the disney characters.	0
1007552	But we agree the best place we lived is ok-ryun dong when I went to middle school.	0
1007553	Secondly, I surf the Internet.	0
1007554	I happen to find a girl of same age.	0
1007555	His name is Eui-won Jung, and he taught us Chinese.	0
1007556	I think animals can be used in medical experiments, because we can't test our medicines or chemicals without any experiments.	0
1007557	And there are no reason to smoke in the building.	0
1007558	We make a prevention that case, then the physical punishment rules can be kept to all schools.	0
1007559	Because they can say everything they want very easily even about the person they don't know actually.	0
1007560	Using animals in medical experiments is always a controversial topic.	0
1007561	I was surprised when an elementary school teacher hit little boy's head with very hard book.	0
1007562	For example, If physical punishment is not allowed in classes, students can threaten and even punch their teachers.	0
1007563	First, If the physical punishment in schools is allowed by laws, many violences are played in classrooms.	0
1007564	However, I do not agree with these crucial teaching method.	0
1007565	For instance, every single teacher I met in my elementary school, they used to say that they don't want to use physical punishment because it hurts their feelings all day long.	0
1007566	also in medically used animal's life, he can save their family and other his nature because of more developed technology.	0
1007567	I want to ride attraction in Disney-Land.	0
1007568	I was very interested in knowing our history.	0
1007569	Well, there are many reasons why I like her.	0
1007570	Some people may say, then where people can smoke?	0
1007571	So I took all of his lectures and tried to be friendly with him.	0
1007572	so I start to study english.	0
1007573	Kids don't hear what teachers say often.	0
1007574	With enjoyable friends, we usually go trip.	0
1007575	Some peole may think sharing and opening information like age or sex is not dangerous.	0
1007576	However, this is very complicated process and this make my family cooperate and solve some problems concerned with this process.	0
1007577	To begin with, without physical punishment students who don't have any interest in studying may not study at all.	0
1007578	however it is not fact.	0
1007579	Some people might say 'If we have to use our real name on the internet, we are resticted to state our opinion'.	0
1007580	It makes their lung more harmed, finally they can get some lung probrems.	0
1007581	What can we do is appreciate to animals used in medical experiments.	0
1007582	Even just small physical punishment can make them afraid of doing same fault.	0
1007583	Because first, he is very kind.	0
1007584	But, after completed mission, We raise overoll strength and proud of me.	0
1007585	By not allowing cell phones while driving, lowering accident rate is prior to developing economic fields to join in the developed countries.	0
1007586	After that teacher started quitting the physical punishment and it worked well for the students.	0
1007587	It is my first time to go to broadcasting place.	0
1007588	If I have the chance, I want to visit Austrailia.	0
1007589	The dog was abandoned and I took him to my house.	0
1007590	In my point of view, forcing all Korean men to complete military service is not right, and all men should be able to choose whether to complete military service or not.	0
1007591	And they thought it was sure thing.	0
1007592	Some may say that using "hands-free" or "blue-tooth" can be an alternative, but they can not be.	0
1007593	It depends on the situation, but these ways can be more effective than physical punishment in teaching and correcting students.	0
1007594	Since it was my first experience, I was very excited.	0
1007595	Medical experiments of animals have given ideas of long life and good health.	0
1007596	She teaches math with various kinds of materials.	0
1007597	For an instance, if a child has a mistake in school.	0
1007598	My familly is happy me.	0
1007599	Plus, another law can be acted; if a person's comment disappear more than 5 times a month, he can't write another comments for about 2 months.	0
1007600	So when my pets died, i am very sad.	0
1007601	I think it's just not right.	0
1007602	Smoking in public place is kind of issue these days.	0
1007603	Actually, physical punishment can make children annoying about their school.	0
1007604	In countries such as USA, they don't physically punish students but when students do forbidded behaviors, they immediately calls their parents and strongly warn about child education.	0
1007605	Of course.	0
1007606	It must be wrong way.	0
1007607	My Friends helped me getting out of river.	0
1007608	See what happen 'Geehachul Pelun neu'.	0
1007609	I saw the video that at every single store in Japan, the Japanese bowed 90 degrees to customers.	0
1007610	My favorite teacher is math teacher.	0
1007611	little fault make big problem.	0
1007612	If people have to use their real name, they should behave carefully in the on-lines because they feel responsibility with their names based on.	0
1007613	other punishment like giving them extra homeworks or minus their score had already lost their power to control them.	0
1007614	Also it is not the way of protecting teachers' power.	0
1007615	I can experince Japanese food, festival and also I can have an information about Japanese idol.	0
1007616	Because living in USA, they can speak in English very well.	0
1007617	Yes, I think that all Korean men should be forced to complete military service.	0
1007618	I liked economics best in my high school days.	0
1007619	Some people believe only by talking smoothly to children or using other soft punishment, children can know their problem and don't do that again.	0
1007620	But after this policy taken, they can't buy cigarret because in smoking zone there will be many eyes that see them buying the cigarret.	0
1007621	they are very cool and considerate about other people.	0
1007622	And when people want to enjoy more freedom, they have to find other ways to enjoy their freedom.	0
1007623	If I eat France's food and meet France's people I will understand France's culture.	0
1007624	People tend to think using real name on the internet as a good thing, because it could make people do more carefully.	0
1007625	Of course, there are some bad things about anonimity.	0
1007626	At that time, I visited his office again, and asked how can I solve this problem.	0
1007627	Some children who show the bad temper to questionaires need to educate man to man, what is good things and what is bad things, not by preaching but by pursuading them accept easy and comfortably.	0
1007628	When people do not use their real name on the Internet, they write things such as slangs or words that will hurt others with their keyboard in a way they will never be able to talk in face to face.	0
1007629	My favorite teacher is Seong	0
1007630	You have family waiting for you at home so don't bring them bad news about you.	0
1007631	If animals don't leave our country because of the medical experiments, human being will also leave anymore and the earth will dead.	0
1007632	I think that it is a very reasonable soultion about it, because it can satisfy two points of the issue.	0
1007633	"She is warm-hearted.	0
1007634	Because the war is not end.	0
1007635	Also, I want to experience Japan cultuer, not book but in real.	0
1007636	Maybe many students get wrong way.	0
1007637	Today kim jung ill is sick.	0
1007638	In Korea, there had been 'love stick' to teach students and to correct misbehaveness.	0
1007639	so bad things are prevalent in the internet especially in Korea.	0
1007640	One form of such sweat, effort and sacrifice is military service.	0
1007641	we are changed that before the game, we were like dead men but after the game we revived!	0
1007642	So we have to take care of them carefully.	0
1007643	and stoping is also very good to economics.	0
1007644	I used to hear that Europe has so old and deep history and places that many architects and students who want to study architect must travel there even once in their lifetime.	0
1007645	It helf they know that fast.	0
1007646	For example, we can give volunteer work to children, or give homework such as reading books and writing essay about them.	0
1007647	Some people killed themselves because it is too painful.	0
1007648	That's true of the case in schools.	0
1007649	Even worse non-smokers get die because of smoker's misconcerning.	0
1007650	For example, young students who get punished physically feel that they are not human but animals.	0
1007651	We stayed at beautiful pension and had fun time at the beach.	0
1007652	They think using cellular phones is not that much dangerous.	0
1007653	So when you driving you have to focus to driving one thing and should not use cellular phone.	0
1007654	It can make smokers irrigated.	0
1007655	First of all I aspire to visit Japan.	0
1007656	So many medical specialists are warnning that people should stop smoking and care their health.	0
1007657	At first, Doing physical punishment to student is the thing that ignore the honor of humanbeing and freedom of students.	0
1007658	Because there are lots of books.	0
1007659	Since I started soccer, I like soccer and P.E.	0
1007660	There are two reasons of it.	0
1007661	During the period, they become the REAL MEN, who are needed for everypart of our life.	0
1007662	When I went to high school, my teachers often punished using tools.	0
1007663	So, combine all the reasons, my opinion for this is that teachers first need to increase they're ability to deal with student by talk and to move them with mind interaction.	0
1007664	Some people says that people should have free name on the internet.	0
1007665	To tell the truth, I accidently lost the watch 2 years ago.	0
1007666	That occurences inspired Both governments to make many arms that don`t take account of previous armistice.	0
1007667	So we have to stay alert while driving.	0
1007668	So, the smokers also have rights to use public buildings and the buildings can't disturb smoking ; their right in KOREA.	0
1007669	In my opinion, to ban smoking in all public buildings is too harsh for them to observe.	0
1007670	The piano that is on my grandfather's living room has special meaning for my family.	0
1007671	Of course, it is best for students to study hard every class without punishment.	0
1007672	I think that, schools should be allowed physical punishment, but not seriously like that.	0
1007673	With using real name, netizens can think more about what they write on the internet and how their writings can effect others.	0
1007674	and he is so good man.	0
1007675	First, studing English could help me find important information in internet.	0
1007676	Banned smoking in public building will give smoking people some difficult time.	0
1007677	But no to use cellular phone's apps.	0
1007678	Nowadays sometimes on TV, there are news that show how badly a teacher punished a student in school.	0
1007679	Most of them probably tries to quit smoking because it can damage their social behaviors.	0
1007680	Although those are the extreme examples of physical punishment, punishments performed in modest degree are still unacceptable for the following reasons.	0
1007681	Also, I liked the step of sloving promblems itself.	0
1007682	i never do this again.	0
1007683	therefore the punishment neglect student's ego.	0
1007684	Although it seems that sometimes the 'physical' thing equals fast and clean, education should be the subject of applying that formula.	0
1007685	I love animal, but we do not have other options.	0
1007686	Smokers usually argue that they have the right and freedom to smoke, but they're missing at this point.	0
1007687	I think it is our future.	0
1007688	Because physical punishment makes children scare, horrible, therefore children become know and think that they were bad, we should not do that.	0
1007689	my favorite teacher in high school is my biology teacher.	0
1007690	I believe that in near future, people will save the endangered species by using drugs that are made through the medical experiments.	0
1007691	Then, you can use your phone.	0
1007692	Just, we are strong so we can use animal like tools is very dangerous thingking.	0
1007693	So teacher use physical punishment for more knowing of student when they have mistake.	0
1007694	I loved baseball, so I was frustrated that there's no one to play baseball with.	0
1007695	Until I met her, I don't like math so my math test score was low.	0
1007696	because there are various materials in the smoke that are made when the smoke got fired.	0
1007697	Obviously, the idea that humans must use their own name on the virtual space may partly solve problem like gossiping but also makes serious problems.	0
1007698	i like to go hollywood.	0
1007699	Because, that could save many people!	0
1007700	But as I look at it, the dangerous peril that could happen when that system started is much bigger than the advantages that could happen as I explained above.	0
1007701	Partly I agree the point.	0
1007702	To human life, it's golden age, having much power, energy and passion.	0
1007703	One year ago, that is when I graduated my high school, though I had poor scores in test, I was very happy with my friends.	0
1007704	And I think the smokers have to consider them becaus it's in the public building!	0
1007705	But when they smell of smoking it bring them declining of energy to concentrate on the jobs.	0
1007706	So, B will be just feel bad.	0
1007707	But, smoking also ruins health of non-smokers who are surrounded by smokers becase of smoke of cigarrets.	0
1007708	For example, we found out the secret of DNA using them and we became able to treat some diseases that had been untreatable in past.	0
1007709	She understood us and sincerely she wants us to go to college that we want to go.	0
1007710	So I was happy ans I more like drawing picture.	0
1007711	In medical experiment there are a lot of problems that are very dangerous for creature.	0
1007712	If students start to ignore teachers, they won't study.	0
1007713	This indirect smoke can impact our health very seriously, for example, it can trigger the cancer, and it makes us to bear disabled children.	0
1007714	Second, I think if there are guidelines about physical punishment, it is not necessary to ban physical punishment from school.	0
1007715	Physical punishment is a effective way to teach it.	0
1007716	Do u tink so?	0
1007717	It is harm to them and society.	0
1007718	Since my dream is to become a manager of a soccer team in my region, I am really into sports which made me interested in P.E class.	0
1007719	We should preserve them as a small social group.	0
1007720	We know that they include toxic.	0
1007721	Some says "Smoking is NOT good, just bad, " but I do not agree with that statement.	0
1007722	I understand that there are some problems of physical punishment.	0
1007723	Second, physical punishment is not a punishment that is made to hit students.	0
1007724	We are best friend.	0
1007725	Smoking is very harmful, so banning smoking in all public buildings are for smoking people too.	0
1007726	But I can't agree with this opinion.	0
1007727	It becomes good chance to make friends, senior, junior people who are, had been, will be in a same military area.	0
1007728	Also, everyone who is driving on the road has a duty to consider other drivers.	0
1007729	We can punish someone who makes other hurt in Internet.	0
1007730	After the incident, I can't drive cars some days.	0
1007731	I guided my teacher in Insadong and we had fun time there.	0
1007732	Likewise, we use the real name because of citizenship.	0
1007733	But sometimes it does really happen.	0
1007734	In this social, Internet plays very important role.	0
1007735	but we are korean men.	0
1007736	So people prefer to new way to use the real name.	0
1007737	But if you do a operate physical punishment to that children, he will feel the pain and finally he realize the what's his fault and never do that thing again.	0
1007738	I met him my after school class in high school.	0
1007739	First of all, I go to the gym to do exercise.	0
1007740	Internet's best advantage is freedom.	0
1007741	Everytimes, everywhere when we think the other's side, we don't have other opinions.	0
1007742	Also he was good at teaching.	0
1007743	For them we make smoking room.	0
1007744	The hurts on their bodies can be cured easily almost but the hurts in their heart can't be cured easily.	0
1007745	But if any body didn't take the military services, how can they behave in the war?	0
1007746	A lot of newspapers report that many people are suffered from other people's verbal obuse on the Internet.	0
1007747	If you did not use animals in medical experiments, your parents or husband would die.	0
1007748	Some males couldn't think the importance of the military service because they didn't wanted to be one.	0
1007749	Which opinion should be choosed?	0
1007750	School lost its doing.	0
1007751	Moreover, by using animals, people could get more knowledge about animals and themselves in that humans are also animals.	0
1007752	Actually I've been to Japan two times before, when I was 1st grade in middle school and 1st grade in high school.	0
1007753	By drivers who behaves like that.	0
1007754	I met her when I was first grade.	0
1007755	They contains children, oid people, disabled, the sickness and pregnant women etc.	0
1007756	so, this is not good at social comunication.	0
1007757	Therefore, smoking in public buildings ought to be banned, because it have a bad effect on people regardless of they are smokers or non-smokers and it can make fire which endanger many people.	0
1007758	It will be difficult, but the pain that animals receive in medical experimetns is very unjust.	0
1007759	He is interested in not only the studying for exam, but also interested in other questions.	0
1007760	In other words, they are aware the necessity about that punishment.	0
1007761	Physical punishment teaches students humanlike values and it's the right way to teach I think.	0
1007762	And in 1st class, I went to China for school travel.	0
1007763	It is very delicious.	0
1007764	For example, celebrities such as singer and comedian may lose their popularity while they are in the military.	0
1007765	For those reasons, I consider the idea as a necessary measure.	0
1007766	As the ages of our parents, it is not matter to punish.	0
1007767	she always talked honest better than anything.	0
1007768	Liking science led me to liking math.	0
1007769	So my family remove stress because of his behavior.	0
1007770	If bus or taxi drivers get accident, all people in the car will be hurt and damaged.	0
1007771	The change can't be made in short time.	0
1007772	For me, my cell phone is very invaluable to me.	0
1007773	So I could learn about being careful.	0
1007774	In dinner we talk about cinema.	0
1007775	This is the most important factor why drivers should not be allowed to use their cell phone.	0
1007776	What I mean is that, for example, one high school teacher punched a student unproperily few month ago.	0
1007777	For our comfort, we should not use celluar phones while driving.	0
1007778	Punishing valuable and beatiful children physically may seem wrong.	0
1007779	But It is more harsh for the patients who need new medical treatments but the treatments are not experimented because other people who feel sympathy to such animals.	0
1007780	Saturday is the day when I have much free times.	0
1007781	I had lived in Seoul to study.	0
1007782	Sometimes I go to resturant with my family to eat dinner.	0
1007783	She is a kindness and heartly.	0
1007784	If I get a chance to travel to any country that I want to go, I would go to Singapore first.	0
1007785	But if this dreams becomes real, We must underatnsd whole thing about our world.	0
1007786	The two cultures are co-existed for a long time, so there are many things we can study from these history.	0
1007787	It means developing a vaccine to prevent that disease could save thousands of cows every year.	0
1007788	It will be a good solution for feature of korea.	0
1007789	Making the Internet another square of conversation would make better democracy.	0
1007790	My favorite teacher in high school is my homeroom teacher.	0
1007791	It is advantageous that there is much communication between society members but it also has problems.	0
1007792	So she's lesson was not bored.	0
1007793	It's not easy to complete and we could get hurt.	0
1007794	Actually i'm not exactly understand this question.	0
1007795	I couldn't take my eyes off picture of Rome when I saw at first.	0
1007796	Therafter I studied hard, my grades went up and I enter YONSEI UNIVERSITY.	0
1007797	In addition, If we change compulsory military service to non-compulsory or alternative, no one will choose to go millitary service.	0
1007798	In this situation, Internet provide people with opportunity to gather to talk about and hear political and social issues.	0
1007799	Untill now, the animal experiment is the only way to gurantee a safety of the medicine, so if the animal experiments are banned, there would be many problems.	0
1007800	But I realized that I studied math only memorizing.	0
1007801	Suppose we are using human to do medical experiments, we might spend a lot of time and money to be admitted by government and subjects and there might be plenty of procedures to pass.	0
1007802	It means that we don't think one more time when we are in the cyber world.	0
1007803	But this is not true.	0
1007804	She said if she use the cellular phone when driving, her concentration is disassamble and distraction is easy to go accident.	0
1007805	They can ask some money to close people of the owner of the real name.	0
1007806	Or I go to bed much more lately when some soccer game is on the TV.	0
1007807	For these reasons, I love math in high school.	0
1007808	Many peole visits public buildings.	0
1007809	In past, there were not a lot of smoking places so many people smoked at streets, public buildings, and parks.	0
1007810	This is my oppinion.	0
1007811	Because I didn't get good scores in the past Su Neung exam.	0
1007812	Forcing them to complete military service is a violence by the society.	0
1007813	Sometimes she gives me a piece of advice, which is usually helpful to me.	0
1007814	But we have intamacy and want to meet.	0
1007815	Due to animal's sacrifce, we can save many human.	0
1007816	Some people argue that military seevice should be completed voluntarily like other countries.	0
1007817	The people who are going to a military service can't do what they want to improve their skills that they learned from high school and university.	0
1007818	But the temporarly bad choice bring to her terrible accident.	0
1007819	Cause my father is heavy smoker i really know how the smoking is terrible.	0
1007820	But, when someone suggest his or her opinion, they need to have responsibility and disclosing their name can be more believable and their opinion is able to be strengthen.	0
1007821	For example, there is "Shibuya" which is very famous for shopping, and there is "Odaiba" which has a very facinating and beautiful 'rainbow bridge'.	0
1007822	Specifically, our math theachers punished us whenever we got low score.	0
1007823	Also when they use animals in important experiments they should think about animals carefully.	0
1007824	And he has different moods in the classroom and out of school.	0
1007825	In conclusion, I don't agree with the physical punishment of children in shools.	0
1007826	"Son, you can read following words in bible.	0
1007827	My brother who likes only sports also be attracted by playing that piano.	0
1007828	I saw a TV program for possibility of accident while driving.	0
1007829	Becaus my sister is well aware of my taste, I want to visit Germany.	0
1007830	It is that make students prohibit themselves.	0
1007831	Many women protest that women have discrimination.	0
1007832	It is parents' opinion.	0
1007833	Of couse, I understand their opinion.	0
1007834	So this reasons, who ask me.	0
1007835	Instead, it is only a violence.	0
1007836	I think smoking in all public buildings has to be banned.	0
1007837	I suggest that it is cruel but essential to use animals to get what we want in medical experiments.	0
1007838	Third, school can use temporary restriction.	0
1007839	I heard that Japan is very clean even tough there are a lot of people living in Japan.	0
1007840	I worried that he hates me.	0
1007841	That time was my first beer time.	0
1007842	And he is very fashionable.	0
1007843	If workers of the company have to use their real names on the company website, they will not be able to express their complains or criticisms about the company without any worry.	0
1007844	Beacuse there are ethical problem with using people in experiments.	0
1007845	My favorite subject was English.	0
1007846	Have you ever eaten meals while you are using cellular phones?	0
1007847	But it is not true.	0
1007848	Because real name using can void people on the internet.	0
1007849	After that, I was allowed to teach students.	0
1007850	So they don't write students' bad actings.	0
1007851	Also, they should look at side mirror carefully not to crash with other cars.	0
1007852	However I disagree with that statement for these following reasons.	0
1007853	Ethics is like a story told by wise grandfather.	0
1007854	The answer is may be 'No'.	0
1007855	But she is not smoke.	0
1007856	It also can be bad to non-smokers.	0
1007857	so you can smoke in this area.	0
1007858	I want to go Japan when I have a chance to travel.	0
1007859	But using animals in experiment is we are free in selecting case.	0
1007860	Every time I see the old paper I feel proud of my great-grandfather, and whenever my friends come to my house I show it to them.	0
1007861	After spending three days in Xi'an we decided to go Zhengzou.	0
1007862	So, at least in the public buildings, smoking should be banned.	0
1007863	We lived in the same apartment so we met almost everyday, and still we get along together.	0
1007864	The answer can not be changed.	0
1007865	The pot reminds my family of living helpful to other people.	0
1007866	It emphasizes the importance of physical punishment.	0
1007867	And spread someone's privacy because they don't like her.	0
1007868	A few months ago, some students who think their teachers are very weak fought with thier teacher and this video shocked many people.	0
1007869	Firstly, the England has attractive landmarks such as the Big ben, Churchs, and museoms or something.	0
1007870	if their reaction is slower, that could cause big accident.	0
1007871	So I agree with physical punishment will be continued in mid and high school - not all schools.	0
1007872	Also Japen have many mountain with nice view and delicious sea food.	0
1007873	However, if we can convince that teacher punish students equally and politely, physical punishment should be allowed.	0
1007874	That may not harm to the other nonsmokers, and protect the smokers' rights.	0
1007875	Of course, restriction of expression in korea is now very little.	0
1007876	I think if he or she doesn't exploit animals, the animal experiments can be adimitted.	0
1007877	The first of advantages is improving mental.	0
1007878	A lot of people in Young-pung-do got heart.	0
1007879	then it is going to be not the horrible place but the likable place i think.	0
1007880	Because the cigarette has higher tax rate than some other commodities.	0
1007881	And he hasn't explination unnessasery.	0
1007882	But after that ski, I have none of money.	0
1007883	there are a lot of ways to punish.	0
1007884	We have to choose our life by ourselves.	0
1007885	Yes, ban smoking in all public buildings.	0
1007886	I think it's harmony.	0
1007887	But for smokers in public buildings, they are invading non-smokers' rights to live in clean area.	0
1007888	she is my best friend.	0
1007889	Why these poor people should die?	0
1007890	The something can be a other car, a animal, and even a person.	0
1007891	Excepting this, teacher has to use another method like imposing bed points to student.	0
1007892	So this kind of experiment can't be assurement of safety.	0
1007893	And they made me more considerate and polite.	0
1007894	Like this, everyone is same and every child is the same child like your child.	0
1007895	And stresses have bad effects on people`s conditions.	0
1007896	It means that they can learn or start smoking easily which is very harmful to young people.	0
1007897	So am I.	0
1007898	We try medical experiments to increase advantages for human's health and disease.	0
1007899	In conclusion, physical punishment, not the violence, should be allowed in all scools.	0
1007900	Whenever I have in trouble some hard actions, they give to me some power.	0
1007901	Some times teachers have many class, and works.	0
1007902	The city looks like Gang Nam at Korea.	0
1007903	As result I can improve my math ability.	0
1007904	To guard our country we should have big army.	0
1007905	I feel really happy in this common life.	0
1007906	There is so much ways to make our children feel sorry and teach a lesson.	0
1007907	If I meet him, I told him about korean amazing culture.	0
1007908	and I am good at math.	0
1007909	First, it is not efficient.	0
1007910	But, Some people say this is not following the teacher.	0
1007911	For example if the government assures people that it will never get in the way reasonable critics, above problems will be solved.	0
1007912	They want to do other things such as helping people in a school or an official centers.	0
1007913	However, someone's life or death cannot be count on number as the researchers did.	0
1007914	I think the 'balance of the power' is the best solution for this topic.	0
1007915	We just made their life end because of our own need.	0
1007916	They have right not to exposed to the the smoke.	0
1007917	This surgery is yang-ak for correcting mandible.	0
1007918	that makes her more happy.	0
1007919	So, my family's special meaning object is our photo album.	0
1007920	So, the school's physical punishment can make students remember their rules and keep their roles as the student.	0
1007921	good guitar is putted in corner in house, guitar's good sound is changed into very bad sound for human's ear.	0
1007922	As many people know, smoking is very harmful to the one who smokes and the people who are with the guy who is smoking.	0
1007923	My past memory about bad comments was so bad.	0
1007924	But I think too much or too serious physical punishment is not effective.	0
1007925	I think everyone has the right pursuing their own happiness.	0
1007926	also i usually go to the library in front of my house.	0
1007927	I think the only way to decrease the danger of the new medicion is by several ewperiments.	0
1007928	However, smokers' thinking is little different.	0
1007929	For exmple, my older brother went to do military service last year.	0
1007930	because, first Republic of South Korea has little money to military service.	0
1007931	using cellphone while driving is like a driking alcohol while driving.	0
1007932	i feel i become very high position.	0
1007933	so i think smoking be banned in all public buildings but as making a smoking area in each building, non-smoker and smoker both can be happy.	0
1007934	But We can't not give up forcing Korean men to complete their military service.	0
1007935	And I can speak Japanese a little bit.	0
1007936	', you should not think that.	0
1007937	And as scientists do not know every procedure of how medical inventions work to animals, the so called 'replacements' could not replace animals.	0
1007938	I can't sure our contry will destroy the enemy and reunify north and south	0
1007939	Even though both sides agreed not to fight in 1953, it does not mean that we are fully reconciled.	0
1007940	I saw one article that using cell phones while driving is as dangerous as drunk driving.	0
1007941	Korean men often complete military service when they are young.	0
1007942	Don't smoking in public building is manner.	0
1007943	It's a wrong stereotype.	0
1007944	Of course, there are problems coming from not using real name on the Internet.	0
1007945	He knows this, he recommanded me scholaship.	0
1007946	It is a unquestionable fact.	0
1007947	So USA is also important country to go.	0
1007948	Nowadays, some Internet sites only require user's nickname to sign up.	0
1007949	because talented people can live longer and they can work for world for longtime staying healthy.	0
1007950	Plus, classes can't be continued.	0
1007951	Some people states that animals have rights so It is too cruel to use animals in medical experiments.	0
1007952	But they don't know that teaching bad student without physical punishment is more dangerous.	0
1007953	So, I think that physical punishment is permitted in the bad circumstance like that.	0
1007954	I wanted to buy somethings because I had passed Yonsei university but I didn't buy anything.	0
1007955	everybody wants to be peaceful, and disagrees to wars for selfish adventages.	0
1007956	And they give him information about his hobby.	0
1007957	I usually spend my Saturdays relieving my stress.	0
1007958	This case is caused by not obeying teachers also.	0
1007959	But physical punishment only has to be used in teaching that bad behavior is not benefit to students.	0
1007960	First, Human rights are ignored if all Korean men are 'FORCED' to complete military service.	0
1007961	At first, stop smoking would not be easy but if the policy continues, it would eventually benefits all the people in the buildings.	0
1007962	If the building have to allow smoking, there is alternative solution to make a smoking room to make smokers to smoke in the pointed area.	0
1007963	I think that we can't know each other is the Internet's most important chracteristic.	0
1007964	Friends knew that Mr.	0
1007965	When I play the games, I don't need to be serious or good.	0
1007966	I think most Korean men must complete military service.	0
1007967	Then, drivers of automobiles not be allowed to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1007968	Men's body is more eligible for military service.	0
1007969	but in fact, there are many negative effect in using unreal name.	0
1007970	My favorite subject was Korean Geography.	0
1007971	Suppose there is no physical punishment.	0
1007972	But even after the barracks life ends, many people believe it's great virtue, and try to adjust it to the society.	0
1007973	Also this cannot be possible if there were not a assisting of my grandparents!	0
1007974	However, it costs a lot and It is not sure that they are believable as animal's.	0
1007975	But when I became the 3rd grade, which is the most important time since it is direct to the exam, I got to meet a awesome man who has been caring for me.	0
1007976	Physical punishment shoule be abondened.	0
1007977	At that time I realized that people must use their real name to control the bad comments.	0
1007978	There are three reasons why they must not be forced.	0
1007979	When I win the novel prize, I will speak your name in adress.	0
1007980	Most of them are word attacks using fake IDs.	0
1007981	so every student and teacher satisfy the school environment.	0
1007982	People should find other way of making Internet clear and reliable.	0
1007983	So I have to protect my cello sounds well.	0
1007984	But before physical punishment, adult and teacher must teach what students is wrong and what they should do.	0
1007985	So, the smoking should be banned for people's health.	0
1007986	Also, we can be more responsible for our remarks.	0
1007987	For these reasons picture of my family is special for me.	0
1007988	Car is exist for human so it should not be risk of human and most busy thing also for someone's happiness.	0
1007989	whether physical punishment should be allowed or not is the matter of both of them.	0
1007990	This means that smoking is more likely to make other people's health bad than smokers.	0
1007991	These planeing, my first time.	0
1007992	however, In the past when their wasn't internet, people who want to state their opinion that was opposite to goverment have to cost a lot.	0
1007993	At that place, he taught me three basic cord.	0
1007994	The Yoon	0
1007995	They feel badly when they were punished.	0
1007996	Just don't make the animals until they can not live their rest of life happy.	0
1007997	In this case, school can't keep going well.	0
1007998	Some people may say that is dangerous to personal privacy or freedom of expression.	0
1007999	There are three reasons for this idea.	0
1008000	For example in our community some schools are not function well.	0
1008001	We just enject a drug to them and check thier body.	0
1008002	Many people say that we must use real name because there are so many people who got hurt.	0
1008003	If we don't want to be hurt by other drivers, we should decrease our risk of accident by phone first.	0
1008004	I don't want to make another person llike my grandfather.	0
1008005	Since I like swimming inside the water, I want to enjoy myself with seaweeds and alive fishes.	0
1008006	So, the medicine needs some kind of test, but it is too risky to test medicines on human on this step of development.	0
1008007	She said that it would protect me from evil spirits.	0
1008008	Second, if we continue the animal experiment, we can get a bad concept : 'lightness' of the life.	0
1008009	It's effect was too slightly to be felt.	0
1008010	When I was seven years old, I went to the art academy.	0
1008011	More and more people join us, Finally, SBS agree reproduction of DVD "Prosecutor Princess".	0
1008012	So, I meet my best friends which is the most ideal task for these purposes.	0
1008013	why TOTO is special to us has many reasons.	0
1008014	We have humanism.	0
1008015	becaous after stoping physical punishment in the news my disadvantage is finded.	0
1008016	Finally, I think that military service can give men responssibility for living in group society.	0
1008017	I can tell you the example what I wnat to say.	0
1008018	And then it read, physical punishment is the violent environment, and children who are exposed to those kinds of violence and agressiveness could be about 20 times easier to be violent and agressive than the others.	0
1008019	In reverse, they cannot insist non-smokers merely to stay away from them because it limits others' right to be somewhere they want to be.	0
1008020	But in my opinion, especially in Korea, the such punishment must be accepted.	0
1008021	First he and I have same hobbies.	0
1008022	Some people contend that netizens don't have to use their real name.	0
1008023	Smoking surely makes a more problem than shouting in a public buildings?	0
1008024	When I was young My dream is soccer player, but now I am not soccer player.	0
1008025	Next day, I got home with not only the new knowledge about English, but friendship with my new friends.	0
1008026	First, it can hurt other individual's feelings.	0
1008027	We can't force smokers to stop smoking, says, smokers have a right to smoke.	0
1008028	Some people ask that they need to use phone on the road, because of an emergency.	0
1008029	And this, in the end, can lead our society to the failure of human well-being related with health.	0
1008030	Physical punishment is too old way.	0
1008031	But I think safety service differs from other service.	0
1008032	In some researches, harms from smoking are more serious and dangerous to non-smokers around smokers.	0
1008033	I like the mathmatic by the same reason.	0
1008034	People use them for calls, messages and Internet surfing everywhere they go.	0
1008035	Some people say the restriction is not fair because it bans the freedom of people.	0
1008036	Of course, If we do not eat animal we live life.	0
1008037	Notebook computer reminds me that event.	0
1008038	Finally, the car was explode and the oil caused larger fire disaster.	0
1008039	Usually, I get up and go to the gym for my health, about two hours.	0
1008040	First is that human being life is more important than animals life.	0
1008041	If the days come, military service will not need to be duty.	0
1008042	I think it is very unfair.	0
1008043	I also saw high school guys.	0
1008044	And then, children take extra study after school or clean the classroom.	0
1008045	Because human can thinking.	0
1008046	North and South.	0
1008047	So whenever I had something wrong to solve the probrem, I went to him.	0
1008048	Of course it is not true.	0
1008049	There are also many people passing by in the street.	0
1008050	Therefore it is not good time to abolish the rule that all men be forced.	0
1008051	First, although we use real name on the Internet, bad netizens will do same things.	0
1008052	Like this example, in addition to their health, smokers can damage other innocent people who do not smoke.	0
1008053	When I hang out with my friends, we go to the movies, play pool or go to the Karaoke which is my favorite.	0
1008054	What we met there was blizard.	0
1008055	It's time to eliminate smoking area.	0
1008056	For saving our right and helping the wounded, people should make an atmosphere in which everyone respect other.	0
1008057	So we also cilmbed mountain Halla.	0
1008058	When I entered the school at age 17, I was not confident and always shy.	0
1008059	Last one is the biggest problem, because the person was just walking, innocently, and the car that was driven by driver who was talking to his or her phone came the hit the innocent person and hurted him badly.	0
1008060	Sometimes I spend time on traveling with friends or families.	0
1008061	In South Korea, however, Most citizen don't want to participate war and they're not used to killing other people.	0
1008062	She once used blocks made of wood to teach us three-dimention.	0
1008063	This is not the light problems and drastic actions must be taken to change people's concept of violence.	0
1008064	In evening sometimes I met frined who rarely meet each other.	0
1008065	And often I go to soccer club I play in or watch Saturday night's EPL	0
1008066	My best friend ji-yeoun is bery kind and she understand my difficulties.	0
1008067	If he didn`t use the cellular phone he couldn live.	0
1008068	but our friendship hardened.	0
1008069	Scientist can discover the side effect of new medicion.	0
1008070	Non-smokers can be ill by harash substances.	0
1008071	we live for a helper	0
1008072	They are more easier and less violent.	0
1008073	They ceaselessly make social problems such as battering new comers, and suiciding.	0
1008074	Second, physical punishment might seem to be effective in short term, but in long term, it has no advantage in children`s acadmic achievement or personality.	0
1008075	So Smoking should be banned in all public buildings for well-being.	0
1008076	Until now my favorite subject is math.	0
1008077	Secondly, i liked the characteristic of Chemistry.	0
1008078	It is proven by science that smoking can cause deadly diseases such as cancer.	0
1008079	Therefore, I wish to eat lots of Japanese traditional food in Japan.	0
1008080	In fact, many teachers use physical punishment very effectively for educational purpose.	0
1008081	So, the students release the stress to wrong thing.	0
1008082	Nothing but only making the feelings of both teacher and students worse.	0
1008083	I was very angry.	0
1008084	My favorite teaher in high school is english teacher park chan uk.	0
1008085	And the physical punishment give a child rocognization that the physical punishment is just a way of punishment.	0
1008086	My favorite teacher in high school is ethics teacher.	0
1008087	At the same time, other species can be damaged because of 'Food Chain system'.	0
1008088	I heard the story of tazimahal, and I appealed it.	0
1008089	However, there are also some teachers who do the physical punishment with no reasons.	0
1008090	To prevent accident like this, drivers using cellphone have to take ticket and fine.	0
1008091	And then I became deligent person.	0
1008092	When they use their phone, they could not response with the other drivers.	0
1008093	One of the many reasons that i prefered subjects that involve language and literature is the fact that people throughout the world express their feelings and give wisdoms through literature, which is how the culture is made and keeps go on.	0
1008094	They have to smoke only in their house, one place.	0
1008095	And without her help I might be have no friends.	0
1008096	Or having a lunch?	0
1008097	According to the research about this matter shows us that the majority of teachers and students want some kinds of physical punishment to be allowed.	0
1008098	When we walk in a building or walk down a street, the most easily seen garbage is cigarretes.	0
1008099	If using the real name have to be forceful, many people will not state their opinion or reply.	0
1008100	Generally other kinds of punishment require much time to children.	0
1008101	because they are very young and often don't have a correct idea.	0
1008102	If It is an emergency or another grave accident, they can use celluar phones with stopping an automobile.	0
1008103	my parents is sad when I am living in another province.	0
1008104	And i think that we need more punishment about that.	0
1008105	My favorite teacher in highschool is English teacher.	0
1008106	Japanese using Koreans and Chinese, and Germans using minor ethnics for medical experiments during The Second World War are blamed.	0
1008107	In the other words, I usually spend my Saturdays for giving me sweet rest.	0
1008108	It is very serious problem.	0
1008109	Thrid day in my vacation, taypoon was coom.	0
1008110	But after i went to highschool my think changed.	0
1008111	I think animals should not be used in medical experiments.	0
1008112	Therefore, we should not use physical punishment in schools and use other methods.	0
1008113	I stool friend's watch when I was 6 years old.	0
1008114	So, I could get a hope again and regained my confidence.	0
1008115	First of all, the troubles between teachers and students happened frequently.	0
1008116	If we adjust the period of completing military service to shorter and working in public offices to longer, the phenomenon that prefering working in public offices will reduce.	0
1008117	My father enjoys going to the mountains.	0
1008118	But I studied in high scool where is in the Gong-ju.	0
1008119	but, our country's secuity is very important espcially today.	0
1008120	because many people don't know about dangerous result of it.	0
1008121	Because Smoking has a millon harmful subtances, smoking must be banned.	0
1008122	Sometimes animals live with human but it is necessary that animal's sacrifice for human.	0
1008123	Smoking in public places harms not smokers but innocent people.	0
1008124	Indeed, in Korea, there were so many incidents in shools last year, because the head of the Seoul Educational Office stopped physical punishment in all schools in Seoul.	0
1008125	If I have a chance to travel, I want to go to United Kingdom.	0
1008126	First, as USA, volunteer's military have to have lot of budget for consistency.	0
1008127	and people is same.	0
1008128	So I can get my interest in Math again, and study hard again.	0
1008129	And this kind of one-way communication cannot make students be responsible for their own deed, which is the real goal of the education program.	0
1008130	Well, there will be two opinions in this problem and there have many adventages and disadventages with the physical punishment.	0
1008131	If they are wrong activity, parent or teacher is theching that.	0
1008132	It's like prison.	0
1008133	Thus, there should exist some restrictions on smoking at least in places which are public.	0
1008134	I think that the survival of us and our society is much more important than the free of expression and the availablity of opinions.	0
1008135	There is two reasons that drivers of automobiles have not to use cellular phones while driving.	0
1008136	In these reasons, I think it is inevitable to use animals in medical experiments.	0
1008137	But I think that all men should have a military experiences for these reasons.	0
1008138	The second reason is that our country doesn't need that much military.	0
1008139	For example, someone who thinks attacking other person's lives should be impossible can service for helping hurt people while military service.	0
1008140	It may last in school, but in real world, when teachers are gone, when there are nobody to scold them, is there an assurance that children would do the right things?	0
1008141	So the quality and quantity of training will be decreased.	0
1008142	The one day, I met one girl who is Japanese in Math class.	0
1008143	For example, people use pig's body to make a surgery scene in film.	0
1008144	This is very important topic.	0
1008145	Also, sometimes, people who walk in the street may get hurt, and people can die because of the driver who uses celluar phones!	0
1008146	Also, people's right should be protected.	0
1008147	So I want to know that how U.S.A. climb the best position and why U.S.A. is the best.	0
1008148	He thinked that the dog is his friend.	0
1008149	animal experiment is a staire to develop.	0
1008150	But middle school and high school student are different.	0
1008151	I do serving and clean the table.	0
1008152	However i think using animals in medical experiments is good for not only human but also animal.	0
1008153	First one is powerful and can be a short time solution, and second one is more hard than first one, and a theacher who use these two weapons great is a best teacher, in my opinion.	0
1008154	This happens same in being forced to complete military service.	0
1008155	First, smoking is a kind of right, but it isn't the right to smoke in some places.	0
1008156	Especially, when using real name.	0
1008157	He told us very precious words.	0
1008158	Not only she is smart, but she has ability to enjoy her life.	0
1008159	War is not just the comparing the number of soldiers.	0
1008160	Sorry to their student, but I think physical punishment is needed.	0
1008161	And their acts being bad.	0
1008162	And no one would express their real ideas about situations.	0
1008163	The physical punishment can affect negatively to schools, students, and even nation.	0
1008164	Always, smoking in public building is a hot issue in our life.	0
1008165	I understand about them and I know that hurt by speaking is so critical.	0
1008166	Sometimes, to lead them, It's inevitable to punish some students in bad way.	0
1008167	Secondly the smell of smoking is so disgusting, so many people can get bad feeling if one smoker smoke ciggarettes in public space.	0
1008168	I real fun.	0
1008169	By banning smoking in the building, many people can enjoy better enviorment and I think that is what public buildings aim to do.	0
1008170	My favorite teacher in high school was a history teacher in school.	0
1008171	Seung.	0
1008172	First, using animals in medical experiments is inevitable for our medical development.	0
1008173	As many people already know, secondhand smoking has much worse effects on health than normal smoking.	0
1008174	Every saturday, we go to somewhere special such as festivals, concerts or zoo.	0
1008175	The good thing is today a lot of people quit smoking.	0
1008176	In my life, I first worked and made some money.	0
1008177	After than they do not escape in fictional personality.	0
1008178	So, somking is a wish of only a few peole.	0
1008179	In addition, using other animals in medical experiments is also not very exact for developing our own medical technology.	0
1008180	First of all, 'the real name policy' is an invasion to talk freely.	0
1008181	Variety kinds of people use public building.	0
1008182	In Korea 35% of grown male smokes.	0
1008183	So, for my dream, which is to be a international somebody, I love English subject.	0
1008184	They can be sent to the jar or be charged of their crimes.	0
1008185	Of course, anmial's life is as precious as human's.	0
1008186	His happy virus make all of my family smile all time.	0
1008187	If smokers only smoke in the room(out side of building) the gas will don't get in the other people and child.	0
1008188	If there is no forced mission for Korean men, there will be no humiliation too.	0
1008189	I realized that there is no one worth him as a teacher.	0
1008190	so many people would die and are in hospital.	0
1008191	Second, these experiments could help ourselves.	0
1008192	In Saturday I usually spend time on playing with my friends and family.	0
1008193	Even North Korea require help to South Korea.	0
1008194	All names have their own meaning in them and it is important to know what it is.	0
1008195	For many reasons, animal experiment is necessary.	0
1008196	When i think about my intersting memory that happened to me in vacation Many things are intersting to me and i choose one.	0
1008197	He is very activity and sociable.	0
1008198	The korean war have been not over from 1950s.	0
1008199	Third, To men, the time for completing military service can be felt as wasting time.	0
1008200	so the case of me Can't Practice piano.	0
1008201	Recently, public education system in Seoul bans the physical punishment in schools because of abuse.	0
1008202	In order to prevent bad effects of public smoking in advance, I think a person's role is vital, as well as government's.	0
1008203	So when I have hard time solving difficult physics problems, I could ask her.	0
1008204	So I think people must use their own real name on using the Internet.	0
1008205	It means that indirect smoking can make non-smokers not only have bad health but also have bad feelings.	0
1008206	If people do not use their real name on the internet, they are not saying as themslves.	0
1008207	So i thank to him everyday about his crossing the lines and being beside me.	0
1008208	This is serious problem which is not simple to say.	0
1008209	Yes, not because I hate it, but because we have to keep buildings clear.	0
1008210	And they would also feel they are becoming minority of the society.	0
1008211	For example, Korean pizza, fruit juice, and dessert.	0
1008212	This is the most interesting thing to me.	0
1008213	I like my best friend's very understanding personality.	0
1008214	Sometimes he give me very bitter word.	0
1008215	Drunken driving is not allowed because of its decreasing driver's ability of judging the situation, and increasing his reaction time.	0
1008216	At first, it can deprive users of attention.	0
1008217	He had his own philosophy of being a teacher.	0
1008218	When he glance at the phone while driving now, he feels kind of scary.	0
1008219	There are kids, babies and people that can be contaminated with smoking gas easily.	0
1008220	People who do bad things on the Internet will do the same when their names are revealed.	0
1008221	I don't think so.	0
1008222	Children could be rude and careless and fearless.	0
1008223	It may cause other drivers to be annoyed, but it is much better than to have an accident.	0
1008224	That people would feel bad to complete military service.	0
1008225	I knew impossible is nothing when we are hard working.	0
1008226	Smoking should be banned in all public buildings.	0
1008227	Soon I started teaching.	0
1008228	I want to see all of Japan.	0
1008229	If the physical punishment is not that harsh, I think they have to be allowed in all schools.	0
1008230	My major is public administration.	0
1008231	I met my best friend named Jaeyoung Ha when I was in middle school.	0
1008232	But it is too dangerous way because in medical experiments, there are so many variations which can be fatal for human body.	0
1008233	They are very sesceptible to such diseases so they should be protected by the law.	0
1008234	So all the students in class can be rude or loud.	0
1008235	- children can do such bad things.	0
1008236	So we have to prevent this kind of fire by banning smoking in public building.	0
1008237	Hacker use our real name to steal our privacy information for many bad purpose.	0
1008238	When I finished that study, I feel very achieved.	0
1008239	For example if there were not protection shots for various disease, many people in the world would be died and the culture that haman have made would not exist.	0
1008240	Sencondly, animals cells or organics are not accurately same as people's so that people can get a critical harm.	0
1008241	So i loved Science when i was at high school.	0
1008242	But sometimes, for example, when my friends get a permit to a university, etc, we drink a lot.	0
1008243	Side roads are just for urgent people, so they can use them totaly freely.	0
1008244	Another reason is here.	0
1008245	If they disagree with their boss, they will be hit, punched, kicked.	0
1008246	To go back to our base, we planed to take a gondora and go down then.	0
1008247	There are two reasons why they must not use their real name on the web.	0
1008248	Korea has special situation, the danger of war.	0
1008249	My friend is not good too, but he likes game very much.	0
1008250	It is not work!!!	0
1008251	So my family take care of her all time.	0
1008252	Thanks to the sacrifices of small animals, 60billions of human being can survive from disease that couldn't been cured in past.	0
1008253	When they throw it away into something that is easily burn, there will be huge fire inside the building.	0
1008254	The value must be given to valuable thing: Moral right must be given and admitted to only human who have reson.	0
1008255	So I will say using animals, but not as a tool.	0
1008256	So I agree with the following questions.	0
1008257	It was little difficult.	0
1008258	Since such culture encourages pelple to show their own ideas to others, it accelerates social development by sharing enormous amount of informations.	0
1008259	Because talking by phones could distract the concentration from driver to avoid other cars.	0
1008260	For these reasons I think that we don't have to right to use animals and we should not used animals in medical experiments.	0
1008261	It was my freind who introduced students to me.	0
1008262	And I like to sing a song which is not only korean songs but also foreign countries' songs.	0
1008263	Physical punishment is not teaching.	0
1008264	Korea and Japan are in very short distance.	0
1008265	I strongly insist that drivers of automobiles must not be allowed to use cell phones while driving.	0
1008266	These days I plan to learn a guitar on Saturdays.	0
1008267	One is that it is not effective to both person and country.	0
1008268	If students get along with each other and follow teacher's advices, they won't be punished.	0
1008269	Smoking should be banned in all public buildings.	0
1008270	using real name can interrupt our privacy.	0
1008271	I does not disagree all that idea.	0
1008272	There are two reasons why: People will propose more constructive and appropriate opinions due to their name and if people are allowed to suggest their ideas anonymously, rumor and comdemn will be prevalent.	0
1008273	But how about our nation?	0
1008274	Beacause we have to follow the rule that university makes.	0
1008275	And, there are many other reasons for me to love this subject.	0
1008276	I went skiing with my friends.	0
1008277	I insist that generous physical punishment can be allowed in all schools for better education.	0
1008278	This is why Korean men be forced to complete military service.	0
1008279	The first reason is that the physical punishment's effect is short.	0
1008280	there are my sad birthday story, my dream and passion and so on.	0
1008281	Therefore, physical punishment should now be banned immediately and must be replaced with more gentle and effective ways.	0

1008283	I am very sleepy in school.	0

1008286	Recently we bought one video game, so called Wii.	0
1008287	Some people says that there is no people to go to army.	0
1008288	Also, as a result of the experiments, we can cure mental disease utiliting same parts between humans and animals.	0
1008289	Because not in weekend, we don't have time to spend together.	0
1008290	I did't understand this situation.	0
1008291	we can have responsibility about our reply, writting.	0
1008292	I go to the movie theater with my best friend during Saturday.	0
1008293	So we may stupid day about day.	0
1008294	But whatever society's character is The first thing human have to do is to respect other's existence.	0
1008295	For the reasons that mentioned above, physical punishment have to be allowed in all schools	0
1008296	Students don't think they can learn many thing to their teacher.	0
1008297	I think we can protect our country not by military power but economic power.	0
1008298	I went to Jeju Island with my friends this vacation.	0
1008299	she always take care our classroom and many time counsling my classroom friend and my.	0
1008300	But, in other case that the drivers who use earphone when they use cell phone, they can concentrate on driving more than the first case.	0
1008301	However they improved themselves in just decades.	0
1008302	But, my worst time was beginning while I really did not realize it.	0
1008303	It is a sort of exaggeration but it shows the irony of banning school punishment.	0
1008304	Instead of physical punishment, the school should provide consulting program for the students with problems.	0
1008305	Considering the disprofit of health and wealth, stopping smoking has many merits.	0
1008306	However, with a kind person's help, we could reach the Mashimello-course, which we were familiar with.	0
1008307	also secondhand smoking can harm a non smoking people.	0
1008308	He usually hit students when they didn't finish their assignments.	0
1008309	For example, when my mock test scores were very low, he tried to comfort me.	0
1008310	Actually, when middle school, I was not good at math.	0
1008311	And my parents thought a lot to take their students.	0
1008312	I like all of science but my favorite subject is biology.	0
1008313	I'm the one of them and I always feel bad when I see smokers in public bulidings and I used to trying to not take breathe passing them or I choose to go another way.	0
1008314	If I have a chance to travel somewhere, I would like to go Japan.	0
1008315	It could be revealed it the designers of the drug performed tests to animals before selling.	0
1008316	For example, once a person says aganist most people's opinion, he or she will be attacked by many other different people and demaged too much.	0
1008317	And as time goes by, the country advises not to punish physically in school and this trend is getting stonger recently, by human right movement.	0
1008318	She is an english teacher and I like her very much since she helped me a lot whenever I have a question.	0
1008319	But she is different.	0
1008320	In fact, no one have right to interfere others doing something they want to do.	0
1008321	In this consequence, using cellular phones while driving was very dangerous.	0
1008322	I think making a student stay in a school and do his or her homework can be one of the substitute means.	0
1008323	Regardless of their kinds, we should respect their own lives and basic rights.	0
1008324	To avoid one hand driving, they do not use cellur phone.	0
1008325	I love kids, but my interest was in philosophy.	0
1008326	It is totally useful to me, and to other new college student.	0
1008327	We made the green tea and it was very delicious.	0
1008328	First, we are in war now.	0
1008329	The best thing that makes fire in buildings or on mountain is unburned cigarette.	0
1008330	And people should try to turn off the cellular phones while driving, it will make drivers concentrate on their driving only, and it will make their driving more safe.	0
1008331	First of all, violence in friends have made issues since some years.	0
1008332	Second, some bad people use false name on the Internet for their money.	0
1008333	Both temples looked similer, but China temple's atmosphere is more cheerful, while Korea temple's was silence.	0
1008334	the teacher that punishes students physically does not cotrol students.	0
1008335	On the Internet, people write about their own thought, and sometimes they discuss some problems with other netizens.	0
1008336	Finally we did get drunken, and walked zegzagly singing song.	0
1008337	We need to strive for it.	0
1008338	It doesn't matter whether the smokers themselves are sick or not.	0
1008339	the people who disagree the topic always say that the animals is 불쌍하다 but don't think the people who sick because they use dangerous goods.	0
1008340	I love animals, and i raise dog named DDory for six years.	0
1008341	Therefore we do not have to anymore answer the phones while driving.	0
1008342	This country have strong of Humanity. especially HISTORICS.	0
1008343	In that moment, I think real naming is very important in internet.	0
1008344	These things should not be.	0
1008345	First I think there's unique passion in Spanish hearts.	0
1008346	In conclusion, enforcing Korean men to complete military service has some advantages in two parts; for the country and individuals.	0
1008347	If we use a cell phone on a car, we can not focus on road we drive or other car drivers.	0
1008348	So, peeple have to be careful when they do two things in the same time.	0
1008349	another cause that i like to go america is that i should learn english.	0
1008350	Humans do not have the right to judge values of lives.	0
1008351	Food was heathy and delicious.	0
1008352	If there are choices whether to complete the military service, there are no reasons for side effects of the service which many Korean suffer from.	0
1008353	I think physical punishment in schools should be not be allowed.	0
1008354	First of all, there are many famous football players who do their best.	0
1008355	First, smoking is very harmful for everyone.	0
1008356	at this situation, revealing a real name is a perfect solution to managing internet.	0
1008357	She is soft.	0
1008358	Without cause, Hitting people is surely bad.	0
1008359	he died 4 years ago , my family really misses my dog.	0
1008360	Second, because of teachers who overuses the physical punishment as their weapone, it should be banned.	0
1008361	I think that cigarette is harmful to not only smokers but non-smokers.	0
1008362	Thirdly, if we don't use animals in medical experiments we can't find out our discoveries that they are harmful for people, animals, and so on.	0
1008363	all opinion of people are different.	0
1008364	Do you know that the drugs you were given are created by this medical experiments.	0
1008365	They must not be forced to complete military service angainst their will.	0
1008366	If physical punishment is disappear, I think many student break the school rules.	0
1008367	Besides as we grow our military power, we can win the North Korea, then we can make our nation one connected nation and we can be happy.	0
1008368	The issue was very hot because he got great chance to earn huge amount of money he ever had, but if his luck is bad, he can earn this chance.	0
1008369	There's many reason.	0
1008370	So i spend most of weekend time helping my parents.	0
1008371	Reviewing those situation, We should know that if there are no any other solution for students' misbehaving, not using the physical punishment cannot be good for educational environments.	0
1008372	Drivers, however, must think they have the duty that walkers and he(or she) is safe.	0
1008373	There are some people who argues that smoking should be permitted in public buildings.	0
1008374	The result showed that the group with the physical punishment had a less level of students misbehaving than the other without the physical punishment.	0
1008375	The men in korea have to do their obeidence in their mostly healthy years.	0
1008376	Today's students bad work is big problem, So teacher must control them.	0
1008377	A event of most interesting things which I went through in winter vacation was going to vivaldi park with my favorite friend's family, my brother, and uncle.	0
1008378	The connection between teachers and students that physical punishment made is a eternal.	0
1008379	So, We must know sourse of the information, and must know who resistered the information.	0
1008380	So I learned from them and I applied to it my studying.	0
1008381	Or the another effective punishment is teacher make students clean bathroom or classroom.	0
1008382	My hobby is to listen to music and to appreciate an art work.	0
1008383	So they undoubtedly need punishment.	0
1008384	As a citizen of Korea, there is lots of services provided.	0
1008385	I met friends I had met in last summer vacation at postect.	0
1008386	It is obvious that banning smoking is the only way to slove this problem.	0
1008387	If I have some problems, I can talk to her.	0
1008388	If you want to use your cellular phone, stop driving and park your car at parking space.	0
1008389	But punishing is needed because this have them to think not doing that.	0
1008390	I don't think so.	0
1008391	one more thing, indirect smoke is more unhealthy.	0
1008392	Many people think animals are member of our family and same beings like human.	0
1008393	England is the first country of democracy, which is the basic part of recent society.	0
1008394	for example, sport clubs or chatting sites which need knowing and understanding each other using their real name on internet sounds friendly and build bond.	0
1008395	Futhermore, as internet has been the free place of speech without considering one's facial visual, house enviroment, career, location of living, it make people said things free and make others accept the opinion only by what speaker said without considering other social factor.	0
1008396	but It isn't right that only 'animals' should be used in medical experiments.	0
1008397	and i can get a applaud of friends.	0
1008398	Or if I study, I feel less responsibility so I study less time or in less concentrate.	0
1008399	Diffrent from other countries like France orU.	0
1008400	If people use their real name then they will be very responsible because everybody knows the writer.	0
1008401	All he need to do is just taking care of some animals.	0
1008402	They can pursue the happiness of their own.	0
1008403	So my classmates made she felt very often angry.	0
1008404	I'd like to know about it.	0
1008405	The school must find ways to deal with troubles withought hitting their students.	0
1008406	So they may be participate in new experiment volunteerly.	0
1008407	According to a surveyed statistics by the Korean National Statistics Bureau, two-thirds of the people conducted said that they can believe statements in the Internet when it is written with one's real name.	0
1008408	school is just room fot student.	0
1008409	First, the system works as a reminder to a man that he is a part of the country and to demand his own legal rights, he should not be so ignorant of his nation.	0
1008410	Therefore, if we want to reduce the possibility of car accidents, we should not use cellular phone while driving our car.	0
1008411	If smokers smoke in public buildings, the gas can't be out as buildings are sealed by a wall.	0
1008412	I'm not saying small animal's life is not important, but I'm saying that medical experiment process may not wasting.	0
1008413	That was unbelievable thing.	0
1008414	we ought to think about the ethics Life of Human and animals has the same value.	0
1008415	But It was very interesting and fresh.	0
1008416	every people have their own situation.	0
1008417	Teacher noticed, and tell him not to steal.	0
1008418	In Korea, all Korean men have to go military service.	0
1008419	Cheon An Ham event also North of Korea's play.	0
1008420	Children are not properties of their parents, teachers, or any other people.	0
1008421	To sum up, if we didn't prohibit using cellular phones while driving, it would cause not only human related problems, but also social problems.	0
1008422	(In my highschool experience, it works very well !	0
1008423	It is too selfish to use their life for our own sake.	0
1008424	Finally, Traffic accident can happen.	0
1008425	Although students are not muture as teacher, they have their think, emotion, value.	0
1008426	I do this ability at yonsei university, like MT, festival and so on.	0
1008427	It can not be accepted.	0
1008428	But If we force people to use their real name on the Internet, people don't write their opinion or political think.	0
1008429	So we have many experiments.	0
1008430	In addition, some weak people, who could not endure the pressure in the military, committed suicides.	0
1008431	if we do not using animal experiments, we must not challenged with lots of virus.	0
1008432	If the weather is bad due to the heavy rain, we play chess.	0
1008433	When it burns, some of these elements fly to the air, so It hurts not only the smoker, but also other non-smoking people in a public building.	0
1008434	I think military service should be change to volunteer thing from compulsory thing.	0
1008435	It will result in better teaching envionment to teachers, so that they can teach their students better.	0
1008436	But this way of punishment is just difficult not can't be.	0
1008437	I think , It's not easy another teacher in earth.	0
1008438	However, if the public buildings have a smoking area, natraully the smokers won't go out of the building and smoke in the smoking area.	0
1008439	If they use their phone while driving and have a accident, the damage rise on not only them but also other people.	0
1008440	Therefore, this clearly indicates how crucial it is that the physical punishment of children in schools must be discarded.	0
1008441	So some people challenged his nationality.	0
1008442	It's just hurt.	0
1008443	It was about how he cared about those students and want them to be back as good students.	0
1008444	And then, Qualified education is not possible.	0
1008445	Yes!	0
1008446	when the music is so sad, my feeling also becomes sad.	0
1008447	If we must exercise medical experiments for human, the subjects of experiments should be humans, not animals.	0
1008448	I usually spend my Saturdays meeting friends.	0
1008449	It is very dangerous to drive car when drivers are drunken.	0
1008450	And, especialy, If Animal experiments is for not medical perpose, but cosmetic perpose(for not 'life thing'), the experiments must be restricted.	0
1008451	Looking them, I determined I will have a unmoving goal in my mind and solve disadvantages in my future.	0
1008452	Can you stand this sad situation?	0
1008453	And it haves a meaning when it is completed.	0
2000001	By the way, I have bucket list for thrilling.	0
2000002	If you are not boring, it's small talking6.	0
2000003	This movie is start of series and sequel is making now.	0
2000004	and Economy is very difficult.	0
2000005	If someone have awful experience (ex, accident) related some colors, someone doesn't like the colors.	0
2000006	I thought counting sheep is helpful for sleeping.	0
2000007	Money or face point clear better.	0
2000008	Because I have the this experience, I somtimes worry about the computer virus when I use the computer	0
2000009	And another example green color makes me stable.	0
2000010	Because i hate thrilling, i don't want to ride roller coaster.	0
2000011	Korea's 1980s was a time of military dictator regime.	0
2000012	The target feel frustrated and other problem will bring out.	0
2000013	Plastic surgery can fastest way for changinng.	0
2000014	So in my case, just special day I make up through lotion, B.B. cream (Blemish Balm cream), and an eyeliner.	0
2000015	it is inefficient.	0
2000016	In short I think that morning call service and free wifi service are good service.	0
2000017	One talker has more earning than another talker, who has small earning feeling inferiority.	0
2000018	Someday, I had a problem in calculation.	0
2000019	idols are slim, Koreans often want to be like celibrities.	0
2000020	As a result, the rate of Korean obesity has been rising dramatically.	0
2000021	I played piano, violin, sang a song, studied painting ect.	0
2000022	These people should not even manage with the help of plastic surgery for cosmetic addition to.	0
2000023	I use a lot of hand lotion.	0
2000024	This song is still remembered.	0
2000025	Therefore it's really important how to behave in front of a child.	0
2000026	To sum up, people's different memories make different preference.	0
2000027	Though they do bad behavior, their children learn how to act themselves whether it's good or bad results.	0
2000028	basically, i use soap, brush, toothbrush, toothpaste, shampoo, nail clipper, a razor and so on.	0
2000029	Why?	0
2000030	I had been frightened recently because of movie “황해”.The genre of “황해” is crime and thriller.	0
2000031	so I regularly use personal care and beauty products	0
2000032	i think that the topic the people avoid during small talk is something facilitating dispute as politics, religion and ideologybecause these matters are delicate, have no correct answer and are boringso people don't usually talk about these mattersfor example, politicswhen people are not friendly each other, talking about politics can be rudebecause they have their opinion each other.	0

2000137	Especially, No.	0
2000138	But my best movie is Avatar.	0
2000139	And people think color changes our feelings.	0
2000140	For example, Blue have some cold feeling and give us something creative thinking.	0
2000141	People are stimulated to see colors.	0
2000142	So other people don't see pants.	0
2000143	Through control the TV programs and movies they watch, we can keep children from violence.	0
2000144	And the reason why service is important I don't want unkind of hotel staff.	0
2000145	Hotel is provide the various services.	0
2000146	Making small talk can be difficult for many people.	0
2000147	We are obligated to obey the law.	0

2000149	By giving the body a break to sleep, your skin is clear.	0
2000150	I think the best way to improve our appearance is being confident.	0
2000151	Through the movie, he showed his genius.	0
2000152	But he forgot to calculate one item which i bouht.	0

2000154	I ever worry about using the internet.	0
2000155	I return change.	0
2000156	That's my hotel I wanted	0
2000157	so i went to the store to buy a printing ink and come back home.	0
2000158	I think alcholic driving is most aggresive.	0
2000159	I couldn't stand, step and I couldn't reach my arms but I had confidence.	0
2000160	They violent movies are usually have a deep impression.	0
2000161	If I do, she has disappointed, clearly.	0
2000162	These examples show favorite colors make people's unique character.	0
2000163	So we can see easily, women children wear pink color clothes, men children wear blue and green colors clothes.	0
2000164	*Socially, my parents never verbally expressed their love to me.	0
2000165	But I think normal people will judge of a color by its feeling upon their mind.	0
2000166	Of course, I try to diet, eating vegetables, eggs, vitamin supplements, etc.	0
2000167	If you want to recall your school days, I recommend this movie, 'Wish'.	0
2000168	Especially I want Internet service.	0
2000169	So I said 'I want a noddle' in English.	0
2000170	So I will take a pet in my hotel, and they can get plenty of rest where make a space for them.	0
2000171	Finally parent's speach pattern affect child's behavior.	0
2000172	I think 'Elegant Lies' is the best movie that I have seen before.	0
2000173	It tells the story of Jack and Rose, who meet on the Titanic.	0
2000174	Because, these days almost TV entertainers are so thin.	0
2000175	First of all, violent movies make children aggressive.	0
2000176	Dieting is so effective way to improve his or her appearance for fatty.	0
2000177	One day, i was doing assignments of the college regarding a speaking class, I tried to finish them but itsuddenly came out of the CD-ROM.	0
2000178	But ,fortunately , My parents don't want me to live general women.	0
2000179	So I need to care of me.	0
2000180	Immediately on arriving at lodging, I wanted to go home.	0
2000181	People pay too expensive price for provided room and board.	0
2000182	First, university is presented an academic clique.	0
2000183	Second, photography shows the momentary situation such as when enter the winning goal in football or fireworks.	0
2000184	they want some change.	0
2000185	When the bank is closed, to exchange money at the hotel is very comfortable.	0
2000186	So i use beauty products.	0
2000187	Because we are the white-clad folk.	0
2000188	At working and hiking, make people too tired.	0
2000189	Since then, sometimes terrible nightmare visit my dream.	0
2000190	For example, get a face lift or nose job can change your looks.	0
2000191	As people grow, people have been placed a lots of situations.	0
2000192	For this reason, I think the darivers lived in Osan are good drivers.	0
2000193	Therefore, Children shouldn't be allowed to watch violent movies until they grow up enough.	0
2000194	Giving a person snuff is lead to be no self-confidence and often feel anxious.	0
2000195	In other words city has few cars.	0
2000196	for example we have experience they choosed the cloths and bags and wallpaper.	0
2000197	It makes someone look better.	0
2000198	But he didn't give up, he has tried again and again.	0
2000199	and Is the diet.	0
2000200	Then, children let into the room.	0
2000201	When I take too much charge, I usually give it again.	0
2000202	so i have used skin lotion and toner.	0
2000203	So, if hotel's price is so expensive, ordinary people like me can't use the hotel.	0
2000204	And, my mother is very conservative.	0
2000205	Also symbolizes danger, warning.	0
2000206	for this reason, I think that hotel's cleanliness is important.	0
2000207	Because all people have not mother and father	0
2000208	I do not use other than that.	0
2000209	However, I think most effective way to improve the appearance of their own is plastic surgery.	0
2000210	In fitness club, people weigh oneself everyday or even often a day.	0
2000211	But my thought is different.	0
2000212	His father thought he was born with artistic talent, so he desperately trained his son.	0
2000213	I have a thrilling and frightening memories.	0
2000214	For example we can exercise.	0
2000215	For example people eat less healthy food.	0
2000216	Because I was taught to go good schools from a child.	0
2000217	In Seoul most drivers are drove too fast.	0
2000218	And there are careless driving problems.	0
2000219	so, I don't know about driving exactly.	0
2000220	In fact, i don't have a special experience.	0
2000221	Because the children are immature age yet, children are watching movie scene, they feel violent acting is great or fantastic.	0
2000222	Age limit should be kept well.	0
2000223	I remember the movie "kwanghae".	0

2000228	Many people have their each talent.	0
2000229	And I also did like her to prevent hackking.	0
2000230	But, sometimes, although we know that the opponent will be inconvenient, in curiosity, we inquire to the opponent about a bad things of the past.	0
2000231	So I did it!	0
2000232	some people have very dangerous way.	0
2000233	This behavior make accident and make trouble other drivers.	0
2000234	But I can't stop riding a ski.	0
2000235	somethimes they fight with other team's fans!	0
2000236	It is necessary to prevent children from watch violent movies.	0
2000237	So I execute perpect greeting service for customer.	0
2000238	If parent's personality is gentle and sincere, child's personality can be gentle and sincere.	0
2000239	second, i like acting.	0

2000241	Mural art has a long and interesting history.	0
2000242	some man is resemble to king.	0
2000243	Yesterday night, the murders had occurred that day.	0
2000244	The signal is changed Blue, I try to start the car.	0

2000246	They make good traffic right and observe the stop line , do not pass unreasonablely.	0
2000247	It's good to women.	0
2000248	Lotteworld has many rides.	0

2000250	I like all kind of machine.	0
2000251	When we are in journey, we go sightseeing and in hotel we do only sleep and shower.	0
2000252	This is the way to growing the store royality.	0
2000253	If a cashier give me too much change, I will tell the truth.	0
2000254	When we think something.	0
2000255	it's too noisy so i'm very stressed.	0
2000256	My customers would be able to get a foot or whole body massage whenever they want without any payment.	0
2000257	I have no idea.	0
2000258	But there is a talent, and effort will be difficult for exceeding a person doing it.	0
2000259	Because I have seen my parent's values closely from my early childhood.	0
2000260	The reason for that, a lot of people have different experiences their youth.	0
2000261	All city road are steep and bumpy.	0
2000262	I also was influenced by my parents's value.	0
2000263	I think my city drivers is very bed.	0
2000264	Because hotel is the palace that people sleep.	0
2000265	Also talking about their family is somtimes rude.	0
2000266	Because these can be more beauty for me.	0
2000267	I think the best way for someone to improve his or her appearance isplastic surgery.	0
2000268	But now we normally don't envy fat people because they looks like they don't care about their health.	0
2000269	If you saw a bloody and violent movie all day, could you distinguish between a real or a movie?	0
2000270	After I grew up more, I have tried to solve a problem by myself , looking on the internet.	0

2000277	In tha past, people was poor.	0
2000278	So I'll stayed appropriate hotel.	0
2000279	Physical factor is of course important, but mental satisfaction is also important.	0
2000280	For example short hair is looks like intelligent or cut.	0
2000281	But it is not good for our health too.	0
2000282	When I saw pictures of their past, if they have not plastic surgery, they would never have been celebrity.	0
2000283	If I stay hotel for longer, I will ask the laundry service.	0
2000284	And I want to date like them.	0

2000290	Thence I went to the cinema whenever the movie comes up and saw the movie	0
2000291	This success doesn't mean wealth, power or honor.	0
2000292	To tell the true, I hate using like this thing..	0

2000312	They must not watch the violent movies.	0
2000313	So cashier also could gave us too much change.	0
2000314	SNS is using Internet and communicate each people.	0
2000315	cosmetic surgeons have made great progress in repairing injuries and damage from burns too.	0

2002620	To the child, it is important to a parent are friendly each other.	0
2002621	First of all, the children whose parents are capable of artistic job would be too high a probability of following same job.	0
2002622	In other instances, if a person raises the Maltese.	0
2002623	Because I had no time.	0

2002640	I searched the Internet to solve the problem.	0
2002641	My acquaintances often say that I am much more handsome than I was overweight.	0
2002642	First, we avoid speaking about the weight.	0
2002643	I think it's a matter of personal taste.	0
2002644	I think the most aggressive driving behaviors are ignoring the signal and cutting in the car.	0
2002645	I think that's' reason is personality experience or environment.	0
2002646	The reason is children don't know how to divide impolite or polite.	0
2002647	However I use a lot of personal care products.	0
2002648	Because many people are busy,so the fastfood often eat.	0
2002649	I have different ability and personality so I have different value from my parents.	0
2002650	It was in elementary school.	0

2002652	If you buy by internet, you can be addict.	0
2002653	Few of bad drivers make many bad drivers.	0
2002654	For example, most cheap and delicious restaurants, good tourism spot should be provided.	0
2002655	So it can be leaked of private information.	0
2002656	Because of their perfect body line.	0
2002657	But I saw many times my father's driving.	0
2002658	The Best Movie that i have seen is 3 idiots that was produced in india.	0
2002659	So, drivers should take care about their driving to avoid car accidents especially students and children.	0
2002660	Also, the jewelry is beautiful and fascinating.	0
2002661	I want to guest will have comfortable rest and get rid of there stress.	0
2002662	And he discount for charge.	0
2002663	The three things are that I think hotel services	0
2002664	So, Don't sleep very well.	0
2002665	If father is very violent, baby boy becomes violent.	0
2002666	It wasn't perfect.	0
2002667	Then he go to the past for girl.	0
2002668	I think that sculpture is drawing in three-dimention.	0
2002669	They said to me, window is privated so computer can't work.	0
2002670	We always keep driving at moderate speed!	0
2002671	And I think self-prais also not good.	0
2002672	To me, same things.	0
2002673	The final reason is children don't establish emotion control ability than children that don't watch violent movie.	0
2002674	I think people are born with artistic talent.	0
2002675	I think children shouldn't look at the violent movies.	0
2002676	Violent TV program or movies, game are bad effect of a little boy.	0
2002677	And this help some people like an other country person who a minority race.	0
2002678	When people really really upset, some people become another character such as mad or crazy man.	0
2002679	At childrenhood, children form the their charactor.	0
2002680	If they are on a diet, they have to enioy that.	0
2002681	So I ran to Yatap Station desperately.	0
2002682	Also baggage service is important because when I travel, I take a lot of things so most of cases my bag is full and heavy.	0
2002683	Also, It was enough amusing scenes of people come out to laugh.	0
2002684	Because my grade is very poor.	0
2002685	a lot of population?	0
2002686	They have a variety of nationalities so they also have different languages, They need a translater to tell their requirement(other services: room service, babysitting service etc) easily.	0
2002687	Therefore, If a cashier give me too much change, I will return again to change.	0
2002688	If things go wrong, I get arrested for stealing.	0
2002689	nothing.	0
2002690	So I will feel more tired and will get annoyed.	0

2002694	They don't have patience.	0
2002695	So they skip a meal or eat instant foods.	0
2002696	But dream builder can modification, just imagination.	0
2002697	When I enter the room, I feel refreshed if the bed is neat and the bathroom is clean.	0
2002698	But, I enjoy that trill.	0
2002699	Because they hit the iceberg.	0
2002700	I have had many problems with a computer.	0
2002701	It left me a precious memory.	0
2002702	That time, I had an unforgettable experience in a cave for five hours.	0
2002703	high-calorie and unbalanced nutrition, are taste good.	0
2002704	When I was a child, I just followed my parents' values.	0
2002705	But, liposuction is not.	0
2002706	It is very hot machine.	0
2002707	We couldn't find another way, Eventually we transformed current computer time into past computer time.	0
2002708	Especially, I almost every day use the shampoo.	0
2002709	And I makeup my face.	0
2002710	Because present society is IT and knowledge society.	0
2002711	Multiple and sometimes inlaid away these people,And.	0
2002712	Because my city is very chaotic and busy.	0
2002713	After my computer was infected, I install vaccine program, V3 and egg medicine.	0
2002714	That's very dangerous and painful.	0
2002715	And I asked to parents that help me.	0
2002716	I think men and women seem to differ from the colors they like and dislike.	0
2002717	Although I had money trouble but I couldn't stop wearing that because it shortens make up time in the morning and looks beautiful, I gain confidence about no makeup face.	0
2002718	Especially, I'm well up in this things because my major is vocal.	0
2002719	Of course the other side does cutting other driver off or weaving in and out of traffic or Honking excessively first and so on.	0
2002720	And i will put a lot of extra hangers and extra towels in hotel room.	0
2002721	Therefore, people are eating healthier food than they used to.	0
2002722	The beauty products make me lovely a little more.	0
2002723	The movie is such story.	0
2002724	Some students are good to play the recoder.	0
2002725	In other words, This kind of talent is not the result of much practice and hard work but an inborn talent.	0
2002726	So, I learned how to be managed by one person.	0
2002727	I highly regard highly regard in anywhere.	0
2002728	Then children turn violent.	0
2002729	We secretly dried wet clothes in jjimjilbang.	0
2002730	Finally the repairman come in my house, and he exchange a hard disk.	0
2002731	Another reason is from the people's surroundings.	0
2002732	In my oppinion, at first, I hate phone calling when I'm driving.	0
2002733	So she worked hard in everyday.	0
2002734	social changes, eating changes a lot.	0
2002735	The red is a color that stimulates the eyes, lack restless and aggressive	0
2002736	But the room shapes are not very different.	0
2002737	After exercising, our body tired and eyes can easily heavily-lidded eyes.	0
2002738	I am also one of those women.	0
2002739	These are my following reasons.	0
2002740	I think it really impolite.	0
2002741	It was really thrilling.	0
2002742	When he falls over trying to avoid people who get a bruise	0
2002743	I am sure that the value of my parent's is what I think.	0
2002744	However, I can be afraid of using the internet if my private information is leaked online.	0
2002745	On the contrary, most of men prefer black or blue or green.	0
2002746	And text has sensitivity.	0
2002747	I change to cosmetics for sensitive skins.	0
2002748	However, in the happy family the children are very polite.	0
2002749	In this film, the main character intervene a thing of the past and change little things.	0
2002750	So people do not read and remember the information.	0
2002751	If some people tailgate, they will cause the car crashes.	0
2002752	And also if they want, we will offer styling to them.	0
2002753	But I am a moral man who is ready to bring the wallet in the police station if i pick up a wallet.	0
2002754	So I didn't try anything.	0
2002755	And that time, a motorcycle just drove past me.	0
2002756	I was really thrilling.	0
2002757	The internet is great and helpful, but sometimes it makes noise.	0
2002758	So, They always seek quickness.	0
2002759	I think people concentrate on their weight.	0
2002760	Bug is very large and it has many foot.	0
2002761	This system can be a short-term gain but if one of the guests went through an unpleasant situation when the two become more and more, I think that is not good for the hotel they charge.	0
2002762	There are so many TV programs which broadcast losing weight is the most important thing and you have to be slim more and more.	0
2002763	Second method is fall in love.	0
2002764	My best movie is <NOTEBOOK>.	0

2002775	These reasons make some people like some colors and dislike others.	0
2002776	The way means my future or dream.	0
2002777	Also, a casher would pay back the money or would be fired if the casher gave me too much change and I did not return it , so I think this is inappropriate situation for a casher.	0
2002778	Small talk is conversation with strange people to break the ice in the social events.	0
2002779	As a result, People better health than past.	0
2002780	There are many reasons about that.	0
2002781	Sea is very fickle.	0
2002782	And red used as the symbol of power.	0
2002783	So other drivers and pedestrians are very dangerous.	0
2002784	But i dreamed.	0
2002785	I fixed my computer and do it my homework finally.	0
2002786	If you are ugly, don't mind about it.	0
2002787	The life of people need art harmonic.	0
2002788	If the concierge is very kind to visitor, they give the points are high for our hotel.	0
2002789	I don't think my opinion is wrong.	0
2002790	Therefore, I believe it is not polite to ask about someone's physical appearance such as weight or height.	0
2002791	Convenience stores sells simply foods and less healthy food.	0
2002792	Dongyun angry heard his telling so fight Gitae.	0
2002793	I didn't want to ride rides called “혜성특급”.	0
2002794	it is so serious.	0

2002796	In convenience store, Managing money is very important.	0
2002797	I think should be clean and friendly.	0
2002798	It is also occured by drivers egocentric behavior and bad habbits.	0
2002799	If I will be the manager of a hotel, I will have the Laundry and shoe-shine service.	0
2002800	For these reasons,I favorite a play of Small Theater.	0
2002801	Drinking and driving is the most dangerous behavior on the road.	0
2002802	Actually some people do not accept fashion as an art, I think that depends on individual's standards about the way accepting all kinds of art.	0
2002803	School zone is retention area who children.	0
2002804	Recently, the personal information are overing through many channels to the bad people.	0
2002805	I heard the sound.	0
2002806	Now, I save a file during my homework from time to time	0
2002807	Especially I interested in the exterior of buildings.	0
2002808	Then they apply what they have learned in the film to real life, which causes harmful effects on society.	0
2002809	also we need to becareful too.	0
2002810	thak you for reading.	0

2002812	However, in the last of lane, Tyrannosaurus has appear suddenly and our car is dropping down!	0
2002813	I think in my city have bad drivers because first of all i also bad driver.	0
2002814	so i called the teacher and said "teacher, i want to go to the toilet.	0
2002815	They develop their ability by practice hard.	0
2002816	I think these methods prevent many online problems.	0
2002817	And then I will have detail services.	0
2002818	I don't know actors, but their acting was very good.	0
2002819	Because knowing ther party's age and name is polite.	0
2002820	You should do constant practicing and like what you do.	0
2002821	Never!	0
2002822	Also, It makes other drivers dangerous and angry.	0

2002827	He said very kindly.	0
2002828	Actually, Fooling around on computer and watching drama is fun.	0
2002829	The reason why I think so is that people tend to fall into temptation.	0
2002830	Because I think that If people judge others by the ages, you'll miss the other traits.	0
2002831	than finally my computer didn't work.	0
2002832	In addition, the dress sense increases more and more if we often wear different clothes.	0
2002833	Almost everything in a serene space is well designed and performed (e.g. sound effects, vision effects), so nothing is extraneous.	0
2002834	I think the most people will choose struggle with their weight in china, because we have modern lifestyle,we can use more money to improve quality of life ,we can buy all kinds of food for dinner,we usually eat lot of fat food,but we don't have enough time to do exercise.then we need work hard on weekdays ,and we sometime have a party on weekend ,we drink lot of cola or wine ,and we usually go to bed very late,we don't have enough sleep ,so we are busy everyday,so we will change fat.	0
2002835	Cleansing can irritate even healthy skin, never mind sensitive or “problem” skin.	0
2002836	Because my city's traffic light system make drivers speeding.	0
2002837	Because the contents is very influence to chirldren, Especially such as teens.	0
2002838	So people like to eat junkfood and eat more than healthy food.	0

2003173	It is very complicated.	0
2003174	Otherwise, my face is crack like drought.	0
2003175	So, they started to eat so-called well-being foods, which are scientifically proven to help people stay healthy and live longer.	0
2003176	These experiences are negative to their lives.	0

2003190	but i also have a feminine color ..why did to that?	0
2003191	Because, hotel is need for sleeping, resting, and doing shower.	0

2003201	While it benefits the injured, the ill and the stressed, the strength of massage therapy in preventing illness and conditions before they develop cannot be overlooked.	0
2003202	But I think practice is much more important than natural talent.	0

2003204	So, he can fix easy things.	0
2003205	but i love it.	0
2003206	Third, when I finish a shower, I use a skin lotion and put the body lotion on.	0

2003208	Second is color message or feeling.	0
2003209	I think most drivers in city are bad.	0
2003210	Now days, they are careful about the food they eat.	0
2003211	Although the hotel has very good facility, if it is inordinately high prices, I don't go that hotel.	0
2003212	I think children should not be allowed to watch violent movies.	0

2003214	It can be pretty naturally.	0
2003215	They get rid of stress doing dance and listen to fast tempo music.	0
2003216	When I received driver education, I learned to observe of turn signal.	0
2003217	So, it is manner that don't ask someone's history of plastic surgery if you notice it.	0
2003218	For example, speed driving, drunk driving, sleep driving are prohibited in most world.	0
2003219	We have to remember road rage and driving aggressively can hurt someone else.	0
2003220	I don't want to start study so to stop using the internet is very difficult to me.	0
2003221	These things are factors that ruin my appearance.	0
2003222	Before you know, they will imitate cruel things those were shown in violent movies and don't know those are bad things, yet.	0
2003223	The meaning of it is that professional killer Leon who were keep roaming around is finally settled in the pot by Matillda.	0
2003224	Fixing Computer is boring and hard working.	0
2003225	So, I have heard a lot of music.	0

2003232	First, when other driver weaves through traffic, they change lanes too often.	0
2003233	I don't have worry about using the internet.	0
2003234	As a result, guest would feel bad and the image of the hotel is worse.	0
2003235	it looked like some people is there with some rustle sound.	0
2003236	After borrowing and try to format.	0

2003243	However If parents always watch a TV programs at night, there child will watch a TV programs with their parents.	0
2003244	The most important factors for me when choosing a hotel is how the hotel is clean and how the manager is kind.	0
2003245	While people eat delicious foods and drink alcohol, people feel guilty.	0
2003246	My body divided cold air.	0
2003247	If you still think, it seems to me with tears	0

2003249	Individual artistic skill is so different.	0
2003250	I was going to take classes at a preparatory school for national college entrance exam.	0
2003251	We can't ignore someone's fashion.	0
2003252	specially, bus drivers, texi drivers, motercycle drivers comply with traffic law.	0
2003253	For example, in case of half-breed (live in father's country), they can speak usually two languages that father and mother's language.	0
2003254	Actually I don't like art, especially drawing.	0
2003255	I usually get much information, listen to music, do my homework, and watch a movie and so on by using internet.	0
2003256	but most people cleverly managed to evade the traffic law.for example when we driving too fast watch speed camera , suddenly we slow down speed.also we have quickly development of communication.	0
2003257	Therefore I will install large screen in a hotel.	0
2003258	May be ,for this reason I like this color.	0
2003259	Because these make them to upset and you make loss to personality.	0
2003260	I think, smiling face makes people feel good and being respeceted.	0
2003261	And then I downloaded internet explorer, fire fox, google crome.	0
2003262	such like japan ryokan.	0
2003263	Lookism is rampant in our country.	0

2003265	And I know I didn't fault anything before.	0
2003266	so they need the protection of the their parents.	0

2003269	But I don't have a musical talent.	0
2003270	So the clerk can recommend a sun cream products for me.	0

2003397	But I think people avoid to gossiping during small talk.	0
2003398	Donald hamburger on highway.	0
2003399	Because services are factors for tempting many visitors.	0
2003400	Although hotel is comfortable, interior and mood is great, if room service is poor, that hotel is really terrible.	0
2003401	It is becaue of social atmosphere and recent trend influnced by mass media here in korea.	0

2004198	Parent's attachment is important for child's development.	0
2004199	However, there is one memorable impressive picture.	0
2004200	There are a lot of things you can do by yourself when you were younger, because my parents are bound to depend on.	0
2004201	I click tiny groove on the back of my laptop.	0

2004208	But my favorite color is purple.	0
2004209	And it is almost using 24 hour.	0
2004210	If I am the manager of a hotel, I will have 24-hour room service, Laundry/shoe-shine service, free airport shuttle, wake-up service and baggage/bell service.	0
2004211	Also they dislike the color that remind them of things they disgust.	0
2004212	Because pople have diffrent religion each other.	0
2004213	I couldn't understand why I was studying these subjects, but I studied hard and did my best.	0
2004214	So, when I choose my hotel, I will prefer the service.	0
2004215	At the end of the day, I find that the CPU has something wrong.	0
2004216	Because they are too fragmented always easy to lose.	0
2004217	I haven't.	0
2004218	Khan try to win her love, He said always 'marry me, marry me!'.	0
2004219	also, bad drivers is speeding.	0
2004220	Suddenly, if you want to overtake the varnish or the illegal U-turn, because it may for example, the driver is surprised, accident occurs, it is very dangerous.	0
2004221	It was really frightened and i never want to go though it again.	0

2004229	Yes, I wory about using internet.	0
2004230	And frightening experience was when I was 5~7.	0
2004231	Of course, a hotel basically offer services such as Internet and bell and wake-up and room services and so on.	0
2004232	That was very funny and fantastic experience for me.	0
2004233	So I avoid talk about politics on purpose.	0
2004234	So now we've got a lot of people in photo composite video on others for fraud.	0
2004235	When I go trip with my friends, we find an accommodation.	0
2004236	me too.	0
2004237	Maumi is just name of dog.	0
2004238	In Seoul most drivers are good, most of them are drive very correctly.	0
2004239	but I was astonished very much.	0
2004240	So they easily imitate that they've seen.	0
2004241	People tend to stayed being healthy without illness.	0
2004242	The river was very dark and not clean even more smell was so disgusting.	0
2004243	I think most drivers in my city are nice drivers.	0
2004244	Also a healthy diet is important for children as well as adults.	0
2004245	For example, Korean singer G-dragon, what's interesting is that he wwas among countless trainees going through YG's rigorous trainee program.	0
2004246	this case lead to an accident too, it is dangerous.	0
2004247	Despite Terribly hard experience, through the camp I could rethink family and friends.	0
2004248	I think parent's behaviors are very important for their child because child only see their parents before they grow up.	0
2004249	I use ‘One-key ghost' to format my computer.	0
2004250	And I even don't paint well.	0
2004251	When using the computer,always thinking.	0
2004252	For example, Children are likely to be more familiar with reading the books if their parents read the books to them or show that they read the books.	0
2004253	So many accidents occur due to drinking too much alcohol.	0
2004254	In case of weave through traffic, the weave driver move fast to moving so it makes another drivers are slightly surprised but it's not going to accident.	0
2004255	Also, the color is related to personality.	0
2004256	A yellow room can make most people feel cheerful and relaxed while a dark green one makes you feel cold and afraid.	0
2004257	He was outstanding than friends.	0
2004258	In 1970,because most korean people were poor and spend all the time for theire family, most of them want to spend therie money for therie happiness.	0
2004259	For example, girl's favorite color is pink and boy's favorite color is blue in some nation.	0
2004260	So by how to set up the camera, picture's moods can be directed veriously.	0
2004261	I believe personality and preferences of the person, to be formed by the environment in which they have lived personally.	0
2004262	It was dark and they could not distinguish between real money and coupons.	0
2004263	But i didn't give up.	0
2004264	My friend 's house was nearby my home.	0
2004265	Last but not the least, when children see fictional characters who commit violent crimes are not sorry for their actions and don't face punishment, they think that doing bad things is not a serious problem.	0
2004266	Because when they have problem about friends or brothers and sisters,if parents have attachment to children, they can consult with parents about their problem.	0
2004267	The blue has properties that is relieves stress and tension.	0
2004268	But once, I will want to experience such a thing.	0
2004269	I think that people should avoid topic about salary, job, marriage, religion, political ideas and so on.	0
2004270	I can't get enough of the movie.	0
2004271	when i wear mascara, i can have dramatic effect.	0
2004272	Therefore, different cultures make some people like some colors and dislike others.	0
2004273	Because drivers who are noisy in my city are at midnight.	0
2004274	The other ways, people who dislike red cause of red dislike receiving attention in crowd.	0
2004275	But, To have habit of caing own body isn't always to go to care center and salon.	0
2004276	I was angry to people who spit on the road or throw away the trash.	0
2004277	Second reason, overfull people already has a slim and balanced body.	0
2004278	I think people are eating healthier than they used to.	0
2004279	Also me too.	0
2004280	- Chaos Theory.	0
2004281	Second, Difference of color preferred in accordance with both men and women.	0
2004282	But people who have special talent tend to be arrogant.	0
2004283	Next day I asked my family whether who called my name.	0
2004284	Not only he but Anyone can make a mistake.	0
2004285	Actually I do not handling computer verry well.	0

2004287	Like this music has power putting one together.	0
2004288	Our athletes played harder than anyone and beat Japan obviously.	0
2004289	Also, do not turns on the turn signal back to the person can cause an accident.	0

2004311	Although when drivers overspeed they feel like exciting, that behavior also dangerous in driving.	0
2004312	Fourth, if you make someone angry or the other way round of that, people swear to each other.	0
2004313	So the kids grow up to be adults, they still like only feminine or masculine colors.	0
2004314	Because violent movies are very bloody and scary.	0
2004315	Even same face, different to see if based on the self confidence.	0

2005185	In my country, most of people are slim.	0
2005186	Otherwise the guest will never come to this hotel again.	0
2005187	Although the politicians are being criticized for a cyber censorship, they are really not stupid.	0

2005189	If you spend more money than your income, it is unreasonable consumption and because I'm a student right now, I can't earn money a lot.	0
2005190	I think so that the reason is two kinds.	0
2005191	Thus most people are eating healthier foods than they used to.	0
2005192	First, my important factor for me when choosing a hotel is how cleans the room.	0
2005193	Good looking can make people imposing.	0
2005194	If artists don't have passion of art, they don't be good and famous artists.	0
2005195	I live in Seoul now.	0
2005196	If I were a tattoo, then he will kill me.	0
2005197	Secondly, I'll choose a hotel by location.	0
2005198	I think that many people in this country struggle with watching their weight.	0
2005199	For example, if father or mother is alcoholics, their children suffer by their parent.	0
2005200	So I think people want to stay slim.	0
2005201	At first, I was scared.	0
2005202	But speaking as pedestrian, I have bothered about the behavior that some driver picking up speed although the traffic lights are orange.	0
2005203	Of course, Exercise isn't have direct effect.	0
2005204	Another reason is that a lot of fast food to eat because of a busy social life fest Modern. people have no time to exercise because of a busy social life.	0
2005205	Originally hers father was conservative father so he never let her go travel without him(father).	0
2005206	So they are late in the morning.	0
2005207	It makes illness like obesity and blind.	0
2005208	that is damaged to me very critically.	0
2005209	also later, violent movies can have a bad influence on children.	0
2005210	For example, parents with young children may dislike a white.	0
2005211	But, as the proverb says, Overdone is worse than undone.	0
2005212	Hard to live and earn a lot of money so I dream a happy day.	0
2005213	Then they are horn on and on.	0
2005214	We use internet anytime and anywhere.	0
2005215	It can also be an aggressive driving behavior.	0
2005216	Violent movies couldn't be very educational.	0
2005217	Certainly, it is not right to belittle somebody to make relationships with others and to self-improvement.	0
2005218	Because politics and religion is own belief.	0
2005219	I respect that as much as I respect having a good self image.	0
2005220	As time passes, people eat much more salty food.	0
2005221	But now my father doesn't that.	0
2005222	I want to looks good by the fashion.	0
2005223	But I think most drivers in my city are good drivers.	0

2005225	10 years ago, I have gone to everland -It is an amusement park in Korea-.There are many rides and attractions, and I took the various rides.	0
2005226	The hotel users could schedule in morning.	0
2005227	But the art is must be new artist, not famous artist.	0
2005228	I think that is no more than thief.	0
2005229	Although human and Navit ribe are very different, they transcend their difference from love.	0
2005230	So I hate that kind of drivers.	0
2005231	It is very important to wear a good clothes.	0
2005232	All people every time want to be slim people even if child.	0
2005233	Wake-up service is important.	0
2005234	So due to bad driving habits innocent people be damaged should not happen.	0
2005235	Then, somehow I think that drivers has good manners.	0
2005236	It can be also diffrent feel, temper, think to many people only it is same thing.	0
2005237	For example, a student vacation, backpacking people etc these people will choose the cheapest room, then I will provide a one-room	0
2005238	They drive very fast in the red light.	0
2005239	They are helpful our body especially kimchi can prevent cancer.	0
2005240	because my country's people are rich now than it was a year ago.	0
2005241	Next, Marital status is also private item.	0
2005242	I think many people afraid to speak a foreign language.	0
2005243	Big shopping center or department store always is crowed people who buying clothes or cosmetic products.	0
2005244	Thease days most people use this way to be more pretty.	0
2005245	Because most people that doing exercise in the morning are older people.	0
2005246	if you improve your appearance,you should make your good skin.	0
2005247	They are affected by environment more easily than adult.	0
2005248	I think the reason is people's experience.	0

2005250	children!!	0

2007166	The appearance is very important for everyone, so all of us would like to show our perfect appearance to others.	0
2007167	First case, children are influenced by the growing environment.	0
2007168	If children has impetuous parents, they are more likely to be impetuous adults.	0
2007169	For example, there are many idol stars.	0

2007171	No, I am not allowed to watch violent movies for children.	0
2007172	So if you do not control them, children to watch violent is not fine.	0
2007173	I think that most people have eaten less healthy foods from children to around 30years.	0
2007174	Reason to think so is desire to improve the quality of life for people.	0
2007175	And I learn nail art and now I do nail care and art myself.	0
2007176	But in some countries, it's impolite to ask the age.	0
2007177	so When I was in my home, my mother used the internet.	0
2007178	I regularly use personal care and beauty products.	0

2007188	And it can make many victims.	0
2007189	Another reason that computer was broken was viruses.	0
2007190	One disturbing conclusion is that the effects of violent viewing last for many years.	0
2007191	My best movie is 'Black'.It is Indian movie that blind girl's life story.	0
2007192	I think artistic talent developed through years of training, practice, and hard work because people said "Rlue of Ten Thousand Hours".	0
2007193	So I am very sad.	0
2007194	For example, one boy see a violent movie, he feel ‘oh!	0
2007195	and now, I like walking around.	0
2007196	Also bad, I am playing with a man.	0

2007203	I have very great memory for high school period.	0

2007206	So red color is popular wallet.	0
2007207	That is a morak act.	0
2007208	For that reason, Korean are interested in well-being food, health club, yoga and so on.	0
2007209	Some colors go well with them but other colors don't go well with them.	0
2007210	Because child's character is greately influenced by home environment.	0
2007211	But, it's just ideal situation.	0

2007226	Also, korean food contains many various nutriment.for example, vitamin,carbohydrate,protein something like that.	0
2007227	I think that driving a car fast is most bother me.	0
2007228	Especially, our country is more serious about this problem than other country because appearance is important more than a bit in Korea and is affected by weight.	0
2007229	it can protect you from the threat.	0

2007240	This movie's main stage is Mapo Bridge and broadcasting studio.	0
2007241	High school until I learned piano.	0
2007242	For example your hotel guest has a disease.	0
2007243	For example, it wouldn't be okay for my parents if I got a tattoo.	0
2007244	Basically, I use shampoo while washing my hair everyday, and shave once a week.	0
2007245	because when i speak other peole's weakness the man is feeling very bad.	0
2007246	You must weigh your words before speaking.	0
2007247	So, I think violent movies are not good for children.	0
2007248	Although someone trains hard, someone reaches the limit.	0
2007249	I felt despair and gloom.	0
2007250	And invisible discrimination exist in our society.	0
2007251	I believe that it's one of the best movies I mean Korean movie.	0
2007252	Luckily I come down mountain safely.	0
2007253	This is because there is no specific answer to interpreting the work of art.	0

2007351	Since fast food was invented, many people now eat in their cars as they travel.	0
2007352	because if i have that money, cashier have to fill it.	0

2008196	yes!	0
2008197	And also, time after time, offsprings will understand our values.	0

2008204	When comparing salaries, the result could be a hostile working environment.	0
2008205	And a big park near my house is always crowded with a lot of exercising people.	0

2008215	If driver cut in line accident crisis will increase.	0
2008216	When i have rest time, i almost play games.	0
2008217	If parents Behave well, their children will grow well too.	0

2008690	If parents throw some trash on the way, children will follow that.	0
2008691	Black makes the atmosphere heavy.	0
2008692	People should avoid age, religion, salary in the work during small talk.	0
2008693	because they did not exercise , only ate the high-calorie meal in their house,so they became fatty.	0

2008695	Parents and my value in any part seem to be a little different.	0

2008702	I think Both are rightyou could get many things just by trying hard.	0
2008703	There are risks in using the Internet.	0
2008704	So high speed is very dangerous.	0
2008705	At this point, I feel most drivers have bad manners.	0
2008706	But, to tell the truth, i can't speak that I have been to live to moral and honest life.	0
2008707	I often hear the music.	0
2008708	The children live with their parents until death.	0
2008709	From this point of view, parents should refrain watching violent movies to children.	0
2008710	I was desperate to control the pimples and to keep my skin clean, but nothing seemed to work.	0
2008711	Hotel provides many services for guests such as free internet service, fitness center, minibar, etc.	0
2008712	It feels like comfortable and goes with everything easily.	0
2008713	I was disconcerted with a sudden failure in the computer system.	0
2008714	Because the car accidents happen at least 2 cars.	0
2008715	Because if tourist don't have car, they must take public transportation.	0
2008716	So parent` behaviors is important.	0
2008717	If there's a girl who is beautiful but doesn't have any confidence, She is not attractive as much as she really has.	0
2008718	and must go to plastic surgery.	0

2008720	According the study, when people are children, they watcheda lot of violent movies, criminal rate is high.	0
2008721	So we save the costs to move to another site.	0
2008722	But it also doesn't make me get out of a car.	0
2008723	To be slim, they have to control their shape.	0
2008724	A parent's behavior affect a child's development through imitation.	0

2008730	Sometimes, the game program occurs error.	0
2008731	It is so realistic and shows the cruel and reality of war.	0
2008732	my other strategy is that hotel staff should be placed on each clients.	0
2008733	Sometimes the drivers are makes me angry.	0
2008734	But, if someone could not improve to find fitting style.	0
2008735	it really frighten.	0
2008736	so after checking in they want to drink or eat somethings.	0
2008737	For this reason, i think people are eating healthier and less healthy foods than they used to.	0
2008738	I think mistake to ask a lot of things.	0
2008739	For example in future, if my son learned playing the guitar a few days.	0

2008748	Anyway, I have fallen in love with chaos.	0
2008749	EtcFinally, the hotel should offer currency exchange service.	0

2008849	They can sometimes wait children, grandma and grandpa who walk slowly.	0
2008850	But I experienced bad driver's driving.	0
2008851	The teacher gives an unusual assignment.	0
2008852	That is confused me.	0
2008853	because my values are frank!	0

2008895	I enrolled online game and submitted my name and phone number.	0
2008896	because customers in hotel wish feel a high-class personso they pay a high cost and they are entitled.	0

2008898	Usually parent bring up a child under her's care.	0
2008899	Because they are so young to judge that violent scene is accepted or denied in society.	0

2008901	In addition, parents are both psychologically and physically the closest person to a child.	0

2008943	so my opinion is that our values almost same from our parents.	0
2008944	However, after that she rapidly loses her passion of painting.	0
2008945	It destroys children's pure emotion.	0
2008946	First, I provide valet parking service.	0
2008947	To observe the traffic signal is most important thing in traffic flow.	0

2008952	If children be allowed to watch violent movies, that children could be violent while they live their whole life.	0
2008953	In conclusion I think although the natural talents importance, practice is much more important than natural talent.	0

2008966	The hotel usually charges for drinks and snacks with a lot of cases, guests can have rather unpleasant.	0
2008967	Therefore laws should limit the use of phones behind the wheel.	0
2008968	Finally, I will have a picking up service because tourists of hotel users don't have vehicles in many cases.	0
2008969	I absolutely will not be a bad driver in the future.	0
2008970	And we avoid topics that partner can't sympathy of story.	0

2008983	That moment is too early.	0
2008984	This process takes some very sweet or very spicy food.	0
2008985	Because personal care is expensive.	0
2008986	I think stare and gesture is the most bother me.	0
2008987	Another prisoner has some trouble with her son.	0
2008988	of course they don't do as bad intention.	0
2008989	So that they had must do carving to handmade.	0

2008993	Last, nowadays, my home computer has a problem about a monitor.	0

2009016	we met a lot of situation or moment in our life about ethnic.	0
2009017	Second, I want to have various breakfast buffet menus.	0
2009018	Because, If you are hoping for a quiet peaceful break then make sure you choose a secluded hotel away from the hectic cities and importantly, away from evening traffic.	0
2009019	At that time, I didn't have self-confidence.	0
2009020	In the city center and housing estate they little honking.	0
2009021	People have to give attention to fashion somewhat because that is closely related with first impression.	0
2009022	So the aggresive driving behaviors I think tailgate is most bad thing to car crash.	0
2009023	They followed traffic rules well.	0
2009024	When I was 17 year old, I went to Kang-Won-Do to go skiing with my family and my cousin's family.	0

2009044	I usually slept when I was take a bus or taxi, or get on the car.	0
2009045	Thesedays, I think that most drivers are bad drivers.	0
2009046	Because the hotel is not a place to stay awhile for few minutes and it is a place to sleep and rest for few days.	0
2009047	However, people also feel same feeling.	0
2009048	but Some of them do, but not all.	0

2009052	First, I usually enjoy eating late-night-meal so I need 24-Hour room service	0
2009053	On this account, I thinkthat weaving through traffic is most aggressive behavior.	0
2009054	Also we should avoid topics about the race problem, abortion, religion because the topics may cause other person's opposing opinion.	0
2009055	Usually I Think artistic sensibility can't be learned.	0
2009056	But some people don't care and don't know about that.	0
2009057	Also I regularly use personal care and I relieve stressed.	0
2009058	Pink is also diverse.	0
2009059	Because domestic tour is more common experience, the room charge of hotel is uppermost in the mind.	0
2009060	So it is hard to stop eating potato chips or fries,As you can see the meansing of the name, 'Slow' food is taking more time than 'fast' food, Because we are living in busy society, we don't have enough time to eat slow food.	0
2009061	In addition to this, I will offer 24-hour room service, In-room minibar, babysitting service, bell service, etc.	0

2010150	I wish I could love someone with crazy passion before dying.	0
2010151	This is because, the driver is the driving ruthlessly and not keep a signal.	0
2010152	So, without the complexity of the road there are not many vehicles.	0
2010153	So hotel have to offer a cleaning room service to the guest.	0
2010154	They lack judgment so They don't know difference between right and wrong.	0
2010155	But almost people in Korea consider the result or the outcome more important than process.	0
2010156	I think most of Korean people usually stay slim easily because of traditional Korean food.	0

2010187	I heard that people who are in lower class usually eat fast food more than healthy “cooking” food.	0
2010188	And parents are having most of a child's time together.	0
2010189	First is gender.	0
2010190	When I was in Melbourne 1 and a half years ago, I reserve a hotel in the center of the city.	0
2010191	But these ways have irreversible side effects.	0
2010192	However there is always possibility that very serious patients who are not capable of going to the emergency room in even nearest hotel.	0
2010193	I think people are born with artistic talent.	0
2010194	so how do you expect this situration in car?	0
2010195	For example, some people live around the sea.	0
2010196	But it can be a little dangerous solution.	0
2010197	That movie director is Michael Bay, main actor is Shia LaBeouf and main actress is Megan Fox.	0
2010198	Because It is a different taste.	0
2010199	So I use this.	0
2010200	My value is not different from my parents.	0
2010201	The reason is the lawyers had met, he must not die yoeng-gu is a lawyer and daughter die.	0
2010202	Probably ‘Drive' has the power to turn people fussy.	0
2010203	Thus, the body becomes good through exercise and diet, it is possible to create a better appearance.	0
2010204	and another reason is streets.	0
2010205	If a man love someone, but he doesn't care his appearance, someone may not like him.	0
2010206	A beautiful mind and a Caring for others mind, first of all a happy heart.	0
2010207	So the hotel service is the most important factors when choosing a hotel.	0
2010208	I saw many paintings when I was young, such as Michelangelo, Picasso, Leonardo da vinci, etc.	0
2010209	hotel Is the resting place of guests.	0
2010210	I am afraid that children may try to imitate what they saw in violent movies.	0
2010211	So I think children should not be allowed to watch violent movies.	0
2010212	But, now I'm not scared.	0
2010213	Second plan is making silent rooms for people who want to be in secret.	0
2010214	like this hair style is very important.	0
2010215	Look at a lot of TV celebrities.	0
2010216	Nowadays, there are many splendid colors exist.	0
2010217	If drivers violate the traffic rules, many drivers would cause many traffic accidents.	0
2010218	Therefore Personality is important our life and society	0
2010219	if people who gain many weight don't exercise,naturally they will be obesity.	0
2010220	Especially when they punished by parent.	0
2010221	I think you fit that can be used.	0
2010222	Especially pink color make me happy.	0
2010223	while my computer droke down, i go to PC room to use the computer, but now i fix my computer perfectly.	0
2010224	First,when we are children,we don't have own value,personality and character.	0
2010225	So if they watch violent movies, they copy violent moives.	0
2010226	That reason, I think all people love Mission Impossible movie.	0
2010227	Also, Crime always existed and exist and will exist in the world.	0
2010228	Second, We should shun talking about politics because each people has a different opinion.	0
2010229	if we want to go there, we can choose hotel through hotel's location.	0
2010230	So I tried to restore my computer.	0
2010231	Those topics are very casual and popural.	0
2010232	Also they need to be brought down to the child's level.	0
2010233	Etc.	0
2010234	And my computer worked.	0
2010235	Actually I think fourth edition is more fun than Third but I won't leave much to be desired if he appeared in the fourth.	0
2010236	Today, many people are busy and have many things that they have to do.	0
2010237	But most of talent is the result that people tries since being young.	0
2010238	Because the hotel has the casino , swimming pool and sauna.	0
2010239	And I will have 24-hour room service.	0
2010240	Because I think the Internet is the best way to get an information.	0
2010241	yellow color makes me happy.	0
2010242	But it isn't easy.	0
2010243	This mean i have artistic talent.	0
2010244	because when ordering to infant, they are playing as they likes.	0
2010245	hotel is very expensive if just sleep.	0
2010246	i think that is not bad action because not crime.	0
2010247	Because you are massaged, you may look very, very young.	0
2010248	For example, The movie 'SAFE HOUSE' can watch more than fifteen years.	0
2010249	8 lane is very rare.	0
2010250	Matilda, she was Natalie Portman in the movie.	0
2010251	He confused between 100won and 500won.	0
2010252	People who had no interest in weight also began struggle with watching their weight I do not know yet what will happen in the future this phenomenon seems to be a good thing to.	0
2010253	Third my files that save in computer disappeared suddenly, although I saved those definitely.	0
2010254	It is hardware problem.	0
2010255	And when people young, they may have bad memory of color.	0
2010256	i squeezed the pimples with my unclean hands whenever it came up.	0
2010257	In the country, There is standard weight.	0
2010258	I couldn't move on the spot.	0
2010259	On the other hand, Klimts want us to feel his work as a lovers by using mild colors.	0
2010260	unfortunately,i accident with another car...	0
2010261	So, they see their parents and follow them naturally.	0
2010262	So it's not a good topics during small talk.	0
2010263	I think first step is neat appearnce and an important factor makes us approach him or her.	0
2010264	It is very dangerous.	0
2010265	The following topics should generally be avoided in chatting."What's you income?"	0
2010266	The Inception concept is insert a though about something.	0
2010267	Hotel employees are so unkind and food is terribel.	0
2010268	Why violent movies have a age limit?	0
2010269	First, people should not ask personal privacy during small talk.	0
2010270	yes I have.	0
2010271	It is troublesome for me to care long hairstyle.	0
2010272	Because the topic makes him think we are worldly people.	0
2010273	In now many of people is too skiny, so they have to exercise to get muscle.	0
2010274	So parent's behaviors affect a child's development even if small things.	0
2010275	And I usually have make up every day to hide my skin condition and look more beautiful.	0
2010276	But there are differences from country to country, asking a privacy is not polite in all country.	0
2010277	Red cloths look good on my style.	0
2010278	So, I think we regularly use personal care and beauty products.	0
2010279	Western Europe was an experience that I would never forget.	0
2010280	I think that the most interesting art is Vincent Van Gogh's The Starry Night.	0
2010281	i ride Gyroswing. it's look really funny.	0
2010282	No!	0
2010283	They usually cut us off or tailgate.	0
2010284	Korean much care about beauty, like face, fashion, and body shape.	0
2010285	And if hotel located around the harlem or red-light district, I use that hotel never.	0
2010286	So, I consider the three factors when I choose a hotel.	0
2010287	Some of people have a special talent in art.	0
2010288	Could be resolved in accordance with the methods listed.	0
2010289	One study shows that contact between parents and a under 3-year-old child affects brain and social skill developments.	0
2010290	but I interest that products.	0
2010291	Sometimes taxi and bus drivers drive dirty.	0
2010292	As a result, I think children have similar value to their parents.	0
2010293	Thus, they aren't flamboyant.	0
2010294	So i want that there are many attraction.	0
2010295	they drive to go their destination or to enjoy driving in city I think most people in my city are good drivers.	0
2010296	I sweat a lot when I eat hot foods and walking.	0
2010297	Further if some children see many violent movies, when they become adult they are more likely to crime than others.	0
2010298	The car made a sudden stop and I narrowly avoid the accident.	0
2010299	Then, I as well as other people will be damaged.	0
2010300	Finally he kill boss and rescue her.	0
2010301	A lot of people think must be healthy, but it is difficult to practice.	0
2010302	My values are differnt from my parent's.	0
2010303	Khaki color likes green color.	0
2010304	Those are cognate with selfishness.	0
2010305	In my case, i don't sure i am a nice driver.	0
2010306	Fashion is very big part of his or her own image.	0
2010307	It is a senstive issue.	0
2010308	Also, attention of children is important.	0
2010309	Most children resemble their parents.	0
2010310	<Joje, tiger, and fishes> was good expressed that common love.	0
2010311	And I called my friend, he was imformed computer, he said to me main problem was connected line so trying connect to bluetooth.	0
2010312	Well-being is their health and happiness.	0
2010313	This is a little effect, many violent scenes bring horrible results.	0
2010314	Magneto was upset this situation, He turned his back to his colleague.	0
2010315	but it is ethically wrong.	0
2010316	But it is nice talking dirty story for me.	0
2010317	In many food companies, they have made low-fat healthy foods, for example low-fat milk.	0
2010318	I work every weekend part time so I have enough money.	0
2010319	I have worried about using the Internet.	0
2010320	because I forgot about it many time.	0
2010321	It is her difficulties.	0
2010322	It is for free.	0
2010323	people do generally small talk for fun.	0
2010324	If your computer is infected, hacker want your information to withdraw your money.	0

2010328	Fashion is Sometimes show up people's condition and feel.	0
2010329	By their dangerous driivnig habit, they might save the time a little, however they must know it can also threaten their life,too.	0
2010330	It will be very helpful in our society and probably It is the most important thing to live in our country.	0
2010331	The most merit that listening music is easily accessible.	0
2010332	Also, to be able to benefit from personal care, use personal care very long time and steadily.	0
2010333	This is because, the development of food storage technology made one were able to keep their food in good condition.	0
2010334	It has effect which is unlike showing the pictures depending on the viewing angle.	0
2010335	I think drawing is amazing art.	0
2010336	so when we are driving, we shouldn't do any other things.	0
2010337	Thus, People priority need artistic genetic and should be followed by hard training.	0

2010341	No, I don't.	0
2010342	Even the driver honks as soon as the green light is on Although I have never drove the vehicle, I think driver should have habit to reduce the honking as soon as possible for citizen.	0
2010343	And she worked harder than anyone else in the world.	0
2010344	Drivers must think that their wrong behaviors make dangerous them.	0
2010345	But My parents think my value is the most important.	0

2010347	So I usually choose hotel that have free internet service.	0
2010348	Driving can be a convenient thing but also can be a dangerous thing.	0
2010349	Sometimes, taxi drivers drive like a side car and run crash narrowly.	0
2010350	This is reason why I chose my major.	0

2010352	In japaness movie, there are ninja and samurai.	0
2010353	For example, four season landscape, mountain landscape, city landscape etc.	0

2010390	Silver means a long life.	0
2010391	In this case, if we suppose that they want to enjoy this party, we will offer clothes which is fit to the concept of the party and also offer styiling for guests who don't know how to wear in the party.	0

2010863	If everyone drives in a good way, There's no more bad drivers.	0
2010864	For example,Leonardo da Vinci.	0
2010865	I think the best way for someone to improve her appearance is pretty smile.	0
2010866	Because healthy body includes many meanings.	0
2010867	If I am the manager of a hotel, I'm going to do wake-up service.	0
2010868	And color has simbol.	0
2010869	For example, Christian, Catholic, Buddhist, Atheist, etc.	0
2010870	These are good topics for small talk.	0
2010871	I guess that these differences come from a generation gap.	0
2010872	At that time, i lost earphones in my classroom.	0
2010873	One says “It's his fault.	0
2010874	And, When I have a boyfriend, my parents ask me “ What his parents do?”.	0
2010875	Hard practice is very important, of course.	0
2010876	But I think these things are necessary for men.	0

2010886	The man is difficult to change significantly in a short period of time.	0
2010887	There are lots of things to improve their appearance.	0
2010888	And then I usually live indoor like a home, bus, classroom, but I always rub a sunblock because ultraviolet rays exist everywhere of course the sun have it., fluorescent light have it, even TV have it!	0
2010889	I think that nowdays,, most people eat less healthy foods than they used to.	0
2010890	So I write a normal girl's story.	0
2010891	What is the value that people behave Depending on different.	0

2010895	So People exercise and go on a diet in order to standardize that standard.	0
2010896	my favorite movie genres are sf, action, fantasy.	0
2010897	after that whenever my notebook have a problem I always do formating.	0
2010898	Colossal storms come because of the weather forecast We all worry, but Weather regardless played really fun.	0
2010899	Ocasionally It is inevitable.	0
2010900	When you talk, must respect your opponents.	0
2010901	Most computer viruses are spread through the Internet.	0
2010902	First, children tend to quickly absorb without filtration like a sponge until their personality and values are built.	0
2010903	So i think diet is the best way to improve his appearance.	0
2010904	So after that concert I did vocal exercises.	0
2010905	But commonly people avoid deep topics like religion, job,Korea, in my country, is open about religion.	0
2010906	Because movies tend to be directed stimulatingly to catch audience's interest.	0
2010907	Especially, I like Gustav Klimt.	0
2010908	It's my best movie.	0
2010909	Then, we can see our city change happily when we are drive.	0
2010910	The vaccine grogram could not solve this situation including v3. So, I did for format, I don't use that site ,I am doing the once virus test at a week constantly.	0
2010911	But now The food situation is come right in Korea.	0
2010912	In my opinion, There are many value differences between me and my parents.	0
2010913	During the funny talk, someone is talking about religidn, atheists will lose interest in the conversation.	0
2010914	If I were a manager of the hotel, I will select bell service and 24-hour room service.	0

2010916	It also show up time to time.	0
2010917	And i could not move the arm and neck.	0
2010918	children should not be allowed to watch a violent movie.	0
2010919	But we have to eat healthy food.	0
2010920	If children were allowed to watch that one, they will be shocked and never forget it.	0
2010921	That was from the customer buying the wine before.	0
2010922	i still remember that.	0
2010923	So, I'm always failed to use make-up products up during one year.	0
2010924	Likewise people are born with artistic talent.	0
2010925	And I like joker's quotes in movie, “you complete me !”.	0
2010926	A car cutting in annoys a car behind.	0
2010927	I think that asking me provoke to offend.	0
2010928	The most important thing in the service seems to be a bright expression.	0
2010929	And they won the game and they broke the people's prefudices.	0
2010930	In my opinion, people have unique inherent personality.	0
2010931	Even unknown people wrote comment throughout my ID.	0
2010932	If it is not(=otherwise), world can be filled with dishonesty money, dishonesty people.	0
2010933	Sometimes parents praised the actions of my well done, and I feel good all day and try to be good daughter.	0
2010934	Additionally, there are many reasons for something makes some people like some colors and dislike others.	0
2010935	I have though in this question for a long time.	0
2010936	Customers can confirm their physical condition without charge and a hotel can attract customers.	0
2010937	I like it best.	0
2010938	I worry about using the Internet.	0
2010939	But Jin seok knew fact for their families Jin tae became army of north korea.	0
2010940	Also taking a trip with my friend? allow well.	0
2010941	We are easily accessible music.	0
2010942	However, we can use internet and can find the cheapest hotel.	0
2010943	I couldn't search the internet so I couldn't find data.	0
2010944	case of korea, is same love red.	0
2010945	I'm not talking about the slim is better than havy.	0
2010946	So If children watched violent movies, children imitate violent behavior.	0
2010947	Likewise, comfortable atmosphere of music is the customer's mind will be relaxed.	0
2010948	I think if i am the manager of a hotel, we should give to honest and substantial attention for customers.	0
2010949	It takes 7 days.	0
2010950	Other person will say "I envy you", but inside they will think "so what?"Self-praise can provoke other person.	0
2010951	Therefore, I was ride on the roller coaster.	0
2010952	when I was young, at that time, My home had a computer, I can interact with computer easily, so I don't worry about using the Internet.	0
2010953	I don't use personal care but I regularly use beauty products.	0
2010954	The blue screen was pop up oftenly.	0
2010955	I should have spread my leg but I closed my leg.	0
2010956	And i first look restaurant's food.	0
2010957	I also saw the movie more than ten times!	0
2010958	There are three reasons.	0
2010959	First of all, children can follow some violent behavior that they watched before.	0
2010960	and later, I felt like familiar things.	0
2010961	Let's see another example.	0
2010962	For example, animated films which make from Disney are watched all people.	0
2010963	So we have to think about it cautiously.	0
2010964	But it does not have to be fast and accurate for the way to beauty.	0
2010965	I had make good a shortage up to 10,000. Over time, lack is not occurrence.	0
2010966	It is occured cancer.	0
2010967	I expirienced that sometimes I got my fists and legs before I talk.	0
2010968	So i think, The driver who don't concede to other drivers, is the most bad driver.	0
2010969	My name is Lee Jeong Hee.	0
2010970	I can't drive, but i think driving at excess speed and competing with other drivers are bad behaviors.	0
2010971	I think that is the most saving transit time.	0
2010972	If their parents are not at home, many dangerous objects expose to children.	0
2010973	So if someone did not this way, they can not last for a long time.	0
2010974	That scene was very respectively memory to me.	0
2010975	I think people are eating less healthy food than they used to.	0
2010976	he was very famous actor in real world, but he didn't know.	0
2010977	Because when people go to travel, the health is important thing.	0
2010978	Also, the circumstance is beautiful and we are heart-warming.	0
2010979	Because I deal with harsh the internet and download the file, my computer viruses are spread through the Internet.	0
2010980	Of course, there are many people who can make it by hard training.	0
2010981	I liked the roller-coaster and biking.	0
2010982	They have a lots of effort to make their masterpieces.	0
2010983	However, there are many differences, if I will just give back to the cashier.	0
2010984	The hotel accommodated a lot of guest and I won't know who stayed in which room.	0
2010985	So film is more impressive and emotion.	0
2010986	For this reason most of students look for fast-food.	0
2010987	it is keep yourself safe on the internet.	0
2010988	I emphasize doing something.	0
2010989	It's free and safe.	0
2010990	If people do that then ther are more healthy before.	0
2010991	It makes a lot of accidents.	0
2010992	We must comply with right driving style and change awareness through social campaign.	0
2010993	Stay Foolish.	0
2010994	Many celebrity died of internet's comment.	0
2010995	If we have a conversation about it, that conversation will be arguement.	0
2010996	Second:Take good care of your skin and face.	0
2010997	However I really hate to talk about the Television dramas and Idol singer's gossips.	0
2010998	Finally, favorite color has an effect on the environment.	0
2010999	when people eat food, people hear about dirty topic, people's feeling get worse.	0
2011000	If parents violent or not polite other people, children also learn and their behavior will be same their parents.	0
2011001	Many people have artistic talent by gene.	0
2011002	It is so dark and gloomy to me.	0
2011003	Although it is difficult to measure the value and worth of all people of this world are different, I believe.	0
2011004	For example, the ancestors draw a picture on the rock.	0
2011005	My opinion is based on experience that shopping with my mom.	0
2011006	Because male is thinks It is color of female.	0
2011007	In conclusion, peoples situation is determined their color	0
2011008	I have many service for guests to provide usability and satisfaction.	0

2013045	so they spend many energy, then they feel toilsome and tired when they return to the hotel.	0
2013046	It can be interpreted differently for different people see figure.	0

2013064	The best way for someone to improve his or her appearance is going to the salon.	0
2013065	And most child spends time with their parents.	0
2013066	Second, The internet can make a lot of friends.	0
2013067	I shouted like this " I can do that ".	0
2013068	Actually, I understand in the morning, traffic congestion because of going office.	0
2013069	If there is not enough space between two cars, when car ahead stop too suddenly, drivers suffer severe damage as a result of traffic accident.	0
2013070	And it's hard to find over speed drivers.	0

2013088	Second reason is self-satisfaction.	0
2013089	My frend and I saw that twice.	0
2013090	And a large number of thing is influence on they to their seeing, listening.	0
2013091	Things like thinking, feels, and so on.	0

2013095	So overall society we have to change the English study. Thanks	0
2013096	Nail shop's cost quiet expensive which I can't take.	0
2013097	So, I think we avoid three topics during small talk with people.	0
2013098	I choise very kind staff, because If the staff not kind, a guest reluctant our hotel, and they have bad feel to our hotel, and they say that "The Sun Tae's hotel is very unkindness, and service is very bad, i never go the sun tae's hotel.	0
2013099	Picture is taken by camera by someone.	0
2013100	So I think they prefer to delicious foods even though that less healthy.	0
2013101	Then one day, I climbed a high- hill.	0
2013102	And third is pool and sauna.	0
2013103	So i am embarrassed.	0
2013104	I really felt Evan who lived an unhappy life through the whole movie.	0

2013107	When I'm going home, stop by the festival.	0
2013108	In our world, many people live different way and different thinking, different culture.	0
2013109	second, this is clean facilities.	0
2013110	Then people want to come back that hotel.	0
2013111	And some people like warm color, another people like cool color.	0
2013112	First, parent's language affect child's thinking and way of speaking.	0
2013113	And inborn talents are additional factors.	0
2013114	Because some are well kept signals, most ignore the signal.	0
2013115	So scientifically is helpful.	0
2013116	On account of developed technology we can use internet on mobile phone; smart phone.	0

2017210	Another reason is a few people tend to regard that fat person can't self-discipline.	0

2019012	Internet is easy to arouse misleading to people.	0
2019013	It is same, for example, music and art.	0

2019047	although I don't like pink color that much now, but I still like all the pink colors	0
2019048	Her parents also don't have artistic talent.	0
2019049	Then I imagine the hotel in movies or drama.	0

2021746	When I was a middle school student, I go to a ski resort whit my family.	0
2021747	Because I can't read music, but I can recognize melody.	0

2021751	I successed losing diet and I have tall thin body.	0
2021752	Music genres what i like are ballad, New age, classic.	0

2021764	Third is buffet's quality.	0
2021765	I believe that people should take care of their outlooks by using beauty care consistently.	0

2021767	For example, TV Show was created the purpose of health.	0
2021768	I think people should avoid religion conversation during small talk.	0
2021769	And the help would like to become with the eldest son to the parents.	0
2021770	Because if I do not return change, the cashier may be worry about unmatched money and sorry for their manager.	0
2021771	They give child the best.	0
2021772	Tourists are limited to know about information of tourist attraction.	0
2021773	So, when other people point out your belief, you are very angry.	0
2021774	First, if the word 'personal care' in this question is for my beauty, for example having massage care or something, I don't have any personal care because it is expensive, and also extravagant for me as a student.	0
2021775	For example pink and blue color.	0
2021776	But It is very convenience and it taste good.	0
2021777	As people more and more, I feel irritation so much and discomportable.	0
2021778	Therefore we must not tailgate.	0
2021779	Sometimes, I make a mistake.	0
2021780	Sometimes cars quickly pass on crosswalk when stop light.	0
2021781	Because my major is piano, I have very strong finger touch.	0
2021782	In past, people focused on delicious foods rather than well-being foods.	0
2021783	Because most Korean have thought that highly educated people is good.	0
2021784	I didn't say "they shouldn't be allowed".	0
2021785	Before long, the car became in a good shape(?!) and then we arrived our picnic area.	0
2021786	I think it is Tailgating to make others go faster or get out of the way.	0

2021793	This leads to obesity.	0
2021794	Because they ignore traffic signal.	0
2021795	If the hotel is dirty, I might not trust all service from the hotel.	0
2021796	and the transport access also has an effect on the choice because I can spend a time effectively.	0
2021797	I sometimes use personal care and beauty products.	0
2021798	Tomorrow I will have to go to a computer repairing center.	0
2021799	It was wrong information and we need to cut this!	0

2021810	Then we can drive comportable.	0
2021811	However, as we have called 'wellbeing' was more good food.	0

2021819	They fight with each other and have chase scene.	0
2021820	So I'd do in that way.	0
2021821	As another example, buy a computer, I want to buy Apple's expensive, but stylish, powerful processor!	0

2021830	I think that people don`t use some topics which have an unpleasant.	0

2022024	I think children should not be allowed to watch violent movies.	0
2022025	they feel boringprobably a guest will be happy and feel satisfaction.	0
2022026	So for a while, I can't eat food.	0
2022027	If I changed more to customer, that is my mistake.	0
2022028	because someone doesn't keep a good distance from the car ahead.	0

2022031	And its genre is family comedy, drama.	0
2022032	More and more Gyro Drop was going up.	0
2022033	Well, maybe some children become more violent when they play with toy guns.	0

2022039	If the parents' side of music or art, talent, obviously, the child will inherit the gene.	0
2022040	Because the Green is a little countrified.	0
2022041	Among the environment, the visual effect has impacted highly to children than other's effect.	0
2022042	Especially, various internet shops and cyberbullying are lethal because internet shops are able to cause a fraud.	0
2022043	But this hurrying behavior makes the traffic jam rather.	0
2022044	Each people has another opinion, and they think "It's right."	0
2022045	Children raised by neglectful parent, no independence, esteem is very low and there is no self-control.	0
2022046	And If people find their difference opinion at the controversy,they may have big troubles each other.	0
2022047	And most of the children like imitation that they saw, so If we are allowed that children watch violent movies, they transform violent.	0
2022048	Those made me frown.	0
2022049	In my city, there are many main roads and many cars so there are many sudden accidents.	0
2022050	There are many ways to improve your looks.	0

2022052	So it doesn't have mass trasit as well as Seoul.	0
2022053	The children don't have judgment and self-control, so no one knows what will happen to.	0
2022054	Someone break the rules secretly, or someone committed a traffic violation in spite of himself.	0
2022055	Children are still emotionally insufficient.	0
2022056	so red color use every way.	0
